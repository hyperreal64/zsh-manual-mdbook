<h2 id="201-description"><a class="header" href="#201-description">20.1 Description</a></h2>
<p>This describes the shell code for the ‘new’ completion system, referred
to as <code>compsys</code>. It is written in shell functions based on the features
described in the previous chapter, <a href="Completion-Widgets.html#Completion-Widgets">Completion
Widgets</a>.</p>
<p>The features are contextual, sensitive to the point at which completion
is started. Many completions are already provided. For this reason, a
user can perform a great many tasks without knowing any details beyond
how to initialize the system, which is described in
<a href="#Initialization">Initialization</a>.</p>
<p>The context that decides what completion is to be performed may be</p>
<ul>
<li>an argument or option position: these describe the position on the
command line at which completion is requested. For example ‘first
argument to rmdir, the word being completed names a directory’;</li>
<li>a special context, denoting an element in the shell’s syntax. For
example ‘a word in command position’ or ‘an array subscript’.</li>
</ul>
<p>A full context specification contains other elements, as we shall
describe.</p>
<p>Besides commands names and contexts, the system employs two more
concepts, <em>styles</em> and <em>tags</em>. These provide ways for the user to
configure the system’s behaviour.</p>
<p>Tags play a dual role. They serve as a classification system for the
matches, typically indicating a class of object that the user may need
to distinguish. For example, when completing arguments of the <code>ls</code>
command the user may prefer to try <code>files</code> before <code>directories</code>, so both
of these are tags. They also appear as the rightmost element in a
context specification.</p>
<p>Styles modify various operations of the completion system, such as
output formatting, but also what kinds of completers are used (and in
what order), or which tags are examined. Styles may accept arguments and
are manipulated using the <code>zstyle</code> command described in <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fzutil-Module">The zsh/zutil
Module</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, tags describe <em>what</em> the completion objects are, and style
<code>how</code> they are to be completed. At various points of execution, the
completion system checks what styles and/or tags are defined for the
current context, and uses that to modify its behavior. The full
description of context handling, which determines how tags and other
elements of the context influence the behaviour of styles, is described
in <a href="#Completion-System-Configuration">Completion System Configuration</a>.</p>
<p>When a completion is requested, a dispatcher function is called; see the
description of <code>_main_complete</code> in the list of control functions below.
This dispatcher decides which function should be called to produce the
completions, and calls it. The result is passed to one or more
<em>completers</em>, functions that implement individual completion strategies:
simple completion, error correction, completion with error correction,
menu selection, etc.</p>
<p>More generally, the shell functions contained in the completion system
are of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>those beginning ‘<code>comp</code>’ are to be called directly; there are only a
few of these;</li>
<li>those beginning ‘<code>_</code>’ are called by the completion code. The shell
functions of this set, which implement completion behaviour and may
be bound to keystrokes, are referred to as ‘widgets’. These
proliferate as new completions are required.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="202-initialization"><a class="header" href="#202-initialization">20.2 Initialization</a></h2>
<p><span id="index-compinstall"></span>
<span id="index-completion-system_002c-installing"></span></p>
<p>If the system was installed completely, it should be enough to call the
shell function <code>compinit</code> from your initialization file; see the next
section. However, the function <code>compinstall</code> can be run by a user to
configure various aspects of the completion system.</p>
<p>Usually, <code>compinstall</code> will insert code into <code>.zshrc</code>, although if
file’s location. Note that it is up to you to make sure that the lines
added to <code>.zshrc</code> are actually run; you may, for example, need to move
them to an earlier place in the file if <code>.zshrc</code> usually returns early.
So long as you keep them all together (including the comment lines at
the start and finish), you can rerun <code>compinstall</code> and it will correctly
locate and modify these lines. Note, however, that any code you add to
this section by hand is likely to be lost if you rerun <code>compinstall</code>,
although lines using the command ‘<code>zstyle</code>’ should be gracefully
handled.</p>
<p>The new code will take effect next time you start the shell, or run
<code>.zshrc</code> by hand; there is also an option to make them take effect
immediately. However, if <code>compinstall</code> has removed definitions, you will
need to restart the shell to see the changes.</p>
<p>To run <code>compinstall</code> you will need to make sure it is in a directory
mentioned in your <code>fpath</code> parameter, which should already be the case if
zsh was properly configured as long as your startup files do not remove
the appropriate directories from <code>fpath</code>. Then it must be autoloaded
(‘<code>autoload -U compinstall</code>’ is recommended). You can abort the
installation any time you are being prompted for information, and your
<code>.zshrc</code> will not be altered at all; changes only take place right at
the end, where you are specifically asked for confirmation.</p>

<p><span id="Use-of-compinit"></span></p>
<h3 id="2021-use-of-compinit"><a class="header" href="#2021-use-of-compinit">20.2.1 Use of compinit</a></h3>
<p><span id="index-compinit"></span>
<span id="index-completion-system_002c-initializing"></span></p>
<p>This section describes the use of <code>compinit</code> to initialize completion
for the current session when called directly; if you have run
<code>compinstall</code> it will be called automatically from your <code>.zshrc</code>.</p>
<p>To initialize the system, the function <code>compinit</code> should be in a
directory mentioned in the <code>fpath</code> parameter, and should be autoloaded
(‘<code>autoload -U compinit</code>’ is recommended), and then run simply as
‘<code>compinit</code>’. This will define a few utility functions, arrange for
all the necessary shell functions to be autoloaded, and will then
re-define all widgets that do completion to use the new system. If you
use the <code>menu-select</code> widget, which is part of the <code>zsh/complist</code>
module, you should make sure that that module is loaded before the call
to <code>compinit</code> so that that widget is also re-defined. If completion
styles (see below) are set up to perform expansion as well as completion
by default, and the TAB key is bound to <code>expand-or-complete</code>, <code>compinit</code>
will rebind it to <code>complete-word</code>; this is necessary to use the correct
form of expansion.</p>
<p>Should you need to use the original completion commands, you can still
bind keys to the old widgets by putting a ‘<code>.</code>’ in front of the widget
name, e.g. ‘<code>.expand-or-complete</code>’.</p>
<p>To speed up the running of <code>compinit</code>, it can be made to produce a
dumped configuration that will be read in on future invocations; this is
the default, but can be turned off by calling <code>compinit</code> with the option
<code>-D</code>. The dumped file is <code>.zcompdump</code> in the same directory as the
startup files (i.e. <code>$ZDOTDIR</code> or <code>$HOME</code>); alternatively, an explicit
file name can be given by ‘<code>compinit -d</code> <code>dumpfile</code>’. The next
invocation of <code>compinit</code> will read the dumped file instead of performing
a full initialization.</p>
<p>If the number of completion files changes, <code>compinit</code> will recognise
this and produce a new dump file. However, if the name of a function or
the arguments in the first line of a <code>#compdef</code> function (as described
below) change, it is easiest to delete the dump file by hand so that
<code>compinit</code> will re-create it the next time it is run. The check
performed to see if there are new functions can be omitted by giving the
option <code>-C</code>. In this case the dump file will only be created if there
isn’t one already.</p>
<p>The dumping is actually done by another function, <code>compdump</code>, but you
will only need to run this yourself if you change the configuration
(e.g. using <code>compdef</code>) and then want to dump the new one. The name of
the old dumped file will be remembered for this purpose.</p>
<p>If the parameter <code>_compdir</code> is set, <code>compinit</code> uses it as a directory
where completion functions can be found; this is only necessary if they
are not already in the function search path.</p>
<p>For security reasons <code>compinit</code> also checks if the completion system
would use files not owned by root or by the current user, or files in
root or by the current user. If such files or directories are found,
<code>compinit</code> will ask if the completion system should really be used. To
avoid these tests and make all files found be used without asking, use
the option <code>-u</code>, and to make <code>compinit</code> silently ignore all insecure
files and directories use the option <code>-i</code>. This security check is
skipped entirely when the <code>-C</code> option is given.</p>
<p><span id="index-compaudit"></span></p>
<p>The security check can be retried at any time by running the function
<code>compaudit</code>. This is the same check used by <code>compinit</code>, but when it is
executed directly any changes to <code>fpath</code> are made local to the function
so they do not persist. The directories to be checked may be passed as
arguments; if none are given, <code>compaudit</code> uses <code>fpath</code> and <code>_compdir</code> to
find completion system directories, adding missing ones to <code>fpath</code> as
necessary. To force a check of exactly the directories currently named
in <code>fpath</code>, set <code>_compdir</code> to an empty string before calling <code>compaudit</code>
or <code>compinit</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-bashcompinit"></span></p>
<p>The function <code>bashcompinit</code> provides compatibility with bash’s
programmable completion system. When run it will define the functions,
<code>compgen</code> and <code>complete</code> which correspond to the bash builtins with the
same names. It will then be possible to use completion specifications
and functions written for bash.</p>

<h3 id="2022-autoloaded-files"><a class="header" href="#2022-autoloaded-files">20.2.2 Autoloaded files</a></h3>
<p><span id="index-completion-system_002c-autoloaded-functions"></span></p>
<p>The convention for autoloaded functions used in completion is that they
start with an underscore; as already mentioned, the <code>fpath/FPATH</code>
parameter must contain the directory in which they are stored. If <code>zsh</code>
was properly installed on your system, then <code>fpath/FPATH</code> automatically
contains the required directories for the standard functions.</p>
<p>For incomplete installations, if <code>compinit</code> does not find enough files
beginning with an underscore (fewer than twenty) in the search path, it
will try to find more by adding the directory <code>_compdir</code> to the search
path. If that directory has a subdirectory named <code>Base</code>, all
subdirectories will be added to the path. Furthermore, if the
subdirectory <code>Base</code> has a subdirectory named <code>Core</code>, <code>compinit</code> will add
all subdirectories of the subdirectories to the path: this allows the
functions to be in the same format as in the <code>zsh</code> source distribution.</p>
<p><span id="index-compdef_002c-use-of-by-compinit"></span></p>
<p>When <code>compinit</code> is run, it searches all such files accessible via
<code>fpath/FPATH</code> and reads the first line of each of them. This line should
contain one of the tags described below. Files whose first line does not
start with one of these tags are not considered to be part of the
completion system and will not be treated specially.</p>
<p>The tags are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>#compdef</code> <code>name</code> ... [ <code>-</code>{<code>p</code>|<code>P</code>} <code>pattern</code> ... [ <code>-N</code> <code>name</code>
... ] ]<br />
The file will be made autoloadable and the function defined in it
will be called when completing <code>name</code>s, each of which is either the
name of a command whose arguments are to be completed or one of a
number of special contexts in the form <code>-``context``-</code> described
below.</p>
<p>Each <code>name</code> may also be of the form ‘<code>cmd``=``service</code>’. When
completing the command <code>cmd</code>, the function typically behaves as if
the command (or special context) <code>service</code> was being completed
instead. This provides a way of altering the behaviour of functions
that can perform many different completions. It is implemented by
setting the parameter <code>$service</code> when calling the function; the
function may choose to interpret this how it wishes, and simpler
functions will probably ignore it.</p>
<p>If the <code>#compdef</code> line contains one of the options <code>-p</code> or <code>-P</code>, the
words following are taken to be patterns. The function will be
called when completion is attempted for a command or context that
matches one of the patterns. The options <code>-p</code> and <code>-P</code> are used to
specify patterns to be tried before or after other completions
respectively. Hence <code>-P</code> may be used to specify default actions.</p>
<p>The option <code>-N</code> is used after a list following <code>-p</code> or <code>-P</code>; it
specifies that remaining words no longer define patterns. It is
possible to toggle between the three options as many times as
necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>#compdef -k</code> <code>style key-sequence</code> ...<br />
This option creates a widget behaving like the builtin widget
<code>style</code> and binds it to the given <code>key-sequence</code>s, if any. The
<code>style</code> must be one of the builtin widgets that perform completion,
namely <code>complete-word</code>, <code>delete-char-or-list</code>, <code>expand-or-complete</code>,
<code>expand-or-complete-prefix</code>, <code>list-choices</code>, <code>menu-complete</code>,
<code>menu-expand-or-complete</code>, or <code>reverse-menu-complete</code>. If the
<code>zsh/complist</code> module is loaded (see <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fcomplist-Module">The zsh/complist
Module</a>) the widget
<code>menu-select</code> is also available.</p>
<p>When one of the <code>key-sequence</code>s is typed, the function in the file
will be invoked to generate the matches. Note that a key will not be
re-bound if it already was (that is, was bound to something other
than <code>undefined-key</code>). The widget created has the same name as the
file and can be bound to any other keys using <code>bindkey</code> as usual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>#compdef -K</code> <code>widget-name</code> <code>style</code> <code>key-sequence</code> [ <code>name</code> <code>style</code>
<code>seq</code> ... ]<br />
This is similar to <code>-k</code> except that only one <code>key-sequence</code> argument
may be given for each <code>widget-name</code> <code>style</code> pair. However, the
entire set of three arguments may be repeated with a different set
of arguments. Note in particular that the <code>widget-name</code> must be
distinct in each set. If it does not begin with ‘<code>_</code>’ this will be
added. The <code>widget-name</code> should not clash with the name of any
existing widget: names based on the name of the function are most
useful. For example,</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">#compdef -K _foo_complete complete-word &quot;^X^C&quot; \ 
  _foo_list list-choices &quot;^X^D&quot;
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>(all on one line) defines a widget <code>_foo_complete</code> for completion,
bound to ‘<code>^X^C</code>’, and a widget <code>_foo_list</code> for listing, bound to
‘<code>^X^D</code>’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>#autoload</code> [ <code>options</code> ]<br />
Functions with the <code>#autoload</code> tag are marked for autoloading but
are not otherwise treated specially. Typically they are to be called
from within one of the completion functions. Any <code>options</code> supplied
will be passed to the <code>autoload</code> builtin; a typical use is <code>+X</code> to
force the function to be loaded immediately. Note that the <code>-U</code> and
<code>-z</code> flags are always added implicitly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>#</code> is part of the tag name and no white space is allowed after it.
The <code>#compdef</code> tags use the <code>compdef</code> function described below; the main
difference is that the name of the function is supplied implicitly.</p>
<p>The special contexts for which completion functions can be defined are:</p>
<p><span id="index-_002darray_002dvalue_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-array-value-</code></p>
<p>The right hand side of an array-assignment (‘<code>name``=(``...``)</code>’)</p>
<p><span id="index-_002dbrace_002dparameter_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-brace-parameter-</code></p>
<p>The name of a parameter expansion within braces (‘<code>${``...``}</code>’)</p>
<p><span id="index-_002dassign_002dparameter_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-assign-parameter-</code></p>
<p>The name of a parameter in an assignment, i.e. on the left hand side of
an ‘<code>=</code>’</p>
<p><span id="index-_002dcommand_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-command-</code></p>
<p>A word in command position</p>
<p><span id="index-_002dcondition_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-condition-</code></p>
<p>A word inside a condition (‘<code>[[``...``]]</code>’)</p>
<p><span id="index-_002ddefault_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-default-</code></p>
<p>Any word for which no other completion is defined</p>
<p><span id="index-_002dequal_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-equal-</code></p>
<p>A word beginning with an equals sign</p>
<p><span id="index-_002dfirst_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-first-</code></p>
<p>This is tried before any other completion function. The function called
may set the <code>_compskip</code> parameter to one of various values: <code>all</code>: no
further completion is attempted; a string containing the substring
<code>patterns</code>: no pattern completion functions will be called; a string
containing <code>default</code>: the function for the ‘<code>-default-</code>’ context will
not be called, but functions defined for commands will be.</p>
<p><span id="index-_002dmath_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-math-</code></p>
<p>Inside mathematical contexts, such as ‘<code>((``...``))</code>’</p>
<p><span id="index-_002dparameter_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-parameter-</code></p>
<p>The name of a parameter expansion (‘<code>$``...</code>’)</p>
<p><span id="index-_002dredirect_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-redirect-</code></p>
<p>The word after a redirection operator.</p>
<p><span id="index-_002dsubscript_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-subscript-</code></p>
<p>The contents of a parameter subscript.</p>
<p><span id="index-_002dtilde_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-tilde-</code></p>
<p>After an initial tilde (‘<code>~</code>’), but before the first slash in the word.</p>
<p><span id="index-_002dvalue_002d_002c-completion-context"></span></p>
<p><code>-value-</code></p>
<p>On the right hand side of an assignment.</p>
<p>Default implementations are supplied for each of these contexts. In most
cases the context <code>-``context``-</code> is implemented by a corresponding
function <code>_``context</code>, for example the context ‘<code>-tilde-</code>’ and the
function ‘<code>_tilde</code>’).</p>
<p>The contexts <code>-redirect-</code> and <code>-value-</code> allow extra context-specific
information. (Internally, this is handled by the functions for each
context calling the function <code>_dispatch</code>.) The extra information is
added separated by commas.</p>
<p>For the <code>-redirect-</code> context, the extra information is in the form
‘<code>-redirect-,``op``,``command</code>’, where <code>op</code> is the redirection
operator and <code>command</code> is the name of the command on the line. If there
is no command on the line yet, the <code>command</code> field will be empty.</p>
<p>For the <code>-value-</code> context, the form is ‘<code>-value-,``name``,``command</code>’,
where <code>name</code> is the name of the parameter on the left hand side of the
assignment. In the case of elements of an associative array, for example
‘<code>assoc=(key &lt;TAB&gt;</code>’, <code>name</code> is expanded to ‘<code>name``-``key</code>’. In certain
special contexts, such as completing after ‘<code>make CFLAGS=</code>’, the
<code>command</code> part gives the name of the command, here <code>make</code>; otherwise it
is empty.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to define fully specific completions as the
functions provided will try to generate completions by progressively
replacing the elements with ‘<code>-default-</code>’. For example, when completing
after ‘<code>foo=&lt;TAB&gt;</code>’, <code>_value</code> will try the names ‘<code>-value-,foo,</code>’ (note
the empty <code>command</code> part), ‘<code>-value-,foo,-default-</code>’
and‘<code>-value-,-default-,-default-</code>’, in that order, until it finds a
function to handle the context.</p>
<p>As an example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">compdef '_files -g &quot;*.log&quot;' '-redirect-,2&gt;,-default-'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>completes files matching ‘<code>*.log</code>’ after ‘<code>2&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;</code>’ for any command
with no more specific handler defined.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">compdef _foo -value-,-default-,-default-
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>specifies that <code>_foo</code> provides completions for the values of parameters
for which no special function has been defined. This is usually handled
by the function <code>_value</code> itself.</p>
<p>The same lookup rules are used when looking up styles (as described
below); for example</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:*:-redirect-,2&gt;,*:*' file-patterns '*.log'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>is another way to make completion after ‘<code>2&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;</code>’ complete files
matching ‘<code>*.log</code>’.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Functions-4"></span></p>
<h3 id="2023-functions"><a class="header" href="#2023-functions">20.2.3 Functions</a></h3>
<p>The following function is defined by <code>compinit</code> and may be called
directly.</p>
<p><span id="index-compdef"></span>
<span id="index-completion-system_002c-adding-definitions"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>compdef</code> [ <code>-ane</code> ] <code>function name</code> ... [ <code>-</code>{<code>p</code>|<code>P</code>} <code>pattern</code>
... [ <code>-N</code> <code>name</code> ...]]<br />
<code>compdef -d</code> <code>name</code> ...<br />
<code>compdef -k</code> [ <code>-an</code> ] <code>function style key-sequence</code> [
<code>key-sequence</code> ... ]<br />
<code>compdef -K</code> [ <code>-an</code> ] <code>function name style key-seq</code> [ <code>name style seq</code> ... ]<br />
The first form defines the <code>function</code> to call for completion in the
given contexts as described for the <code>#compdef</code> tag above.</p>
<p>Alternatively, all the arguments may have the form
‘<code>cmd``=``service</code>’. Here <code>service</code> should already have been
defined by ‘<code>cmd1``=``service</code>’ lines in <code>#compdef</code> files, as
described above. The argument for <code>cmd</code> will be completed in the
same way as <code>service</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>function</code> argument may alternatively be a string containing
almost any shell code. If the string contains an equal sign, the
above will take precedence. The option <code>-e</code> may be used to specify
the first argument is to be evaluated as shell code even if it
contains an equal sign. The string will be executed using the <code>eval</code>
builtin command to generate completions. This provides a way of
avoiding having to define a new completion function. For example, to
complete files ending in ‘<code>.h</code>’ as arguments to the command <code>foo</code>:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">compdef '_files -g &quot;*.h&quot;' foo
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The option <code>-n</code> prevents any completions already defined for the
command or context from being overwritten.</p>
<p>The option <code>-d</code> deletes any completion defined for the command or
contexts listed.</p>
<p>The <code>name</code>s may also contain <code>-p</code>, <code>-P</code> and <code>-N</code> options as
described for the <code>#compdef</code> tag. The effect on the argument list is
identical, switching between definitions of patterns tried
initially, patterns tried finally, and normal commands and contexts.</p>
<p>The parameter <code>$_compskip</code> may be set by any function defined for a
pattern context. If it is set to a value containing the substring
‘<code>patterns</code>’ none of the pattern-functions will be called; if it
is set to a value containing the substring ‘<code>all</code>’, no other
function will be called. Setting <code>$_compskip</code> in this manner is of
particular utility when using the <code>-p</code> option, as otherwise the
dispatcher will move on to additional functions (likely the default
one) after calling the pattern-context one, which can mangle the
display of completion possibilities if not handled properly.</p>
<p>The form with <code>-k</code> defines a widget with the same name as the
<code>function</code> that will be called for each of the <code>key-sequence</code>s; this
is like the <code>#compdef -k</code> tag. The function should generate the
completions needed and will otherwise behave like the builtin widget
whose name is given as the <code>style</code> argument. The widgets usable for
this are: <code>complete-word</code>, <code>delete-char-or-list</code>,
<code>expand-or-complete</code>, <code>expand-or-complete-prefix</code>, <code>list-choices</code>,
<code>menu-complete</code>, <code>menu-expand-or-complete</code>, and
<code>reverse-menu-complete</code>, as well as <code>menu-select</code> if the
<code>zsh/complist</code> module is loaded. The option <code>-n</code> prevents the key
being bound if it is already to bound to something other than
<code>undefined-key</code>.</p>
<p>The form with <code>-K</code> is similar and defines multiple widgets based on
the same <code>function</code>, each of which requires the set of three
arguments <code>name</code>, <code>style</code> and <code>key-seq</code>uence, where the latter two
are as for <code>-k</code> and the first must be a unique widget name beginning
with an underscore.</p>
<p>Wherever applicable, the <code>-a</code> option makes the <code>function</code>
autoloadable, equivalent to <code> autoload -U  ``function</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The function <code>compdef</code> can be used to associate existing completion
functions with new commands. For example,</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">compdef _pids foo
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>uses the function <code>_pids</code> to complete process IDs for the command <code>foo</code>.</p>
<p>Note also the <code>_gnu_generic</code> function described below, which can be used
to complete options for commands that understand the ‘<code>-``-help</code>’
option.</p>

<p><span id="index-completion-system_002c-configuration"></span></p>
<p>This section gives a short overview of how the completion system works,
and then more detail on how users can configure how and when matches are
generated.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Overview-1"></span></p>
<h3 id="2031-overview"><a class="header" href="#2031-overview">20.3.1 Overview</a></h3>
<p>When completion is attempted somewhere on the command line the
completion system begins building the context. The context represents
everything that the shell knows about the meaning of the command line
and the significance of the cursor position. This takes account of a
number of things including the command word (such as ‘<code>grep</code>’ or
‘<code>zsh</code>’) and options to which the current word may be an argument
(such as the ‘<code>-o</code>’ option to <code>zsh</code> which takes a shell option as an
argument).</p>
<p>The context starts out very generic (&quot;we are beginning a completion&quot;)
and becomes more specific as more is learned (&quot;the current word is in a
position that is usually a command name&quot; or &quot;the current word might be a
variable name&quot; and so on). Therefore the context will vary during the
same call to the completion system.</p>
<p>This context information is condensed into a string consisting of
multiple fields separated by colons, referred to simply as ‘the context’
in the remainder of the documentation. Note that a user of the
completion system rarely needs to compose a context string, unless for
example a new function is being written to perform completion for a new
command. What a user may need to do is compose a <em>style</em> pattern, which
is matched against a context when needed to look up context-sensitive
options that configure the completion system.</p>
<p>The next few paragraphs explain how a context is composed within the
completion function suite. Following that is discussion of how <em>styles</em>
are defined. Styles determine such things as how the matches are
generated, similarly to shell options but with much more control. They
are defined with the <code>zstyle</code> builtin command (<a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fzutil-Module">The zsh/zutil
Module</a>).</p>
<p>The context string always consists of a fixed set of fields, separated
by colons and with a leading colon before the first. Fields which are
not yet known are left empty, but the surrounding colons appear anyway.
The fields are always in the order
<code>:completion:``function``:``completer``:``command``:``argument``:``tag</code>.
These have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The literal string <code>completion</code>, saying that this style is used by
the completion system. This distinguishes the context from those
used by, for example, zle widgets and ZFTP functions.</li>
<li>The <code>function</code>, if completion is called from a named widget rather
than through the normal completion system. Typically this is blank,
but it is set by special widgets such as <code>predict-on</code> and the
various functions in the <code>Widget</code> directory of the distribution to
the name of that function, often in an abbreviated form.</li>
<li>The <code>completer</code> currently active, the name of the function without
the leading underscore and with other underscores converted to
hyphens. A ‘completer’ is in overall control of how completion is to
be performed; ‘<code>complete</code>’ is the simplest, but other completers
exist to perform related tasks such as correction, or to modify the
behaviour of a later completer. See <a href="#Control-Functions">Control
Functions</a> for more information.</li>
<li>The <code>command</code> or a special <code>-``context``-</code>, just at it appears
following the <code>#compdef</code> tag or the <code>compdef</code> function. Completion
functions for commands that have sub-commands usually modify this
field to contain the name of the command followed by a minus sign
and the sub-command. For example, the completion function for the
<code>cvs</code> command sets this field to <code>cvs-add</code> when completing arguments
to the <code>add</code> subcommand.</li>
<li>The <code>argument</code>; this indicates which command line or option argument
we are completing. For command arguments this generally takes the
form <code>argument-``n</code>, where <code>n</code> is the number of the argument, and
for arguments to options the form <code>option-``opt``-``n</code> where <code>n</code> is
the number of the argument to option <code>opt</code>. However, this is only
the case if the command line is parsed with standard UNIX-style
options and arguments, so many completions do not set this.</li>
<li>The <code>tag</code>. As described previously, tags are used to discriminate
between the types of matches a completion function can generate in a
certain context. Any completion function may use any tag name it
likes, but a list of the more common ones is given below.</li>
</ul>
<p>The context is gradually put together as the functions are executed,
starting with the main entry point, which adds <code>:completion:</code> and the
<code>function</code> element if necessary. The completer then adds the <code>completer</code>
element. The contextual completion adds the <code>command</code> and <code>argument</code>
options. Finally, the <code>tag</code> is added when the types of completion are
known. For example, the context name</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">:completion::complete:dvips:option-o-1:files
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>says that normal completion was attempted as the first argument to the
option <code>-o</code> of the command <code>dvips</code>:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">dvips -o ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>and the completion function will generate filenames.</p>
<p>Usually completion will be tried for all possible tags in an order given
by the completion function. However, this can be altered by using the
<code>tag-order</code> style. Completion is then restricted to the list of given
tags in the given order.</p>
<p>The <code>_complete_help</code> bindable command shows all the contexts and tags
available for completion at a particular point. This provides an easy
way of finding information for <code>tag-order</code> and other styles. It is
described in <a href="#Bindable-Commands">Bindable Commands</a>.</p>
<p>When looking up styles the completion system uses full context names,
including the tag. Looking up the value of a style therefore consists of
two things: the context, which is matched to the most specific (best
fitting) style pattern, and the name of the style itself, which must be
matched exactly. The following examples demonstrate that style patterns
may be loosely defined for styles that apply broadly, or as tightly
defined as desired for styles that apply in narrower circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, many completion functions can generate matches in a simple
and a verbose form and use the <code>verbose</code> style to decide which form
should be used. To make all such functions use the verbose form, put</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' verbose yes
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>in a startup file (probably <code>.zshrc</code>). This gives the <code>verbose</code> style
the value <code>yes</code> in every context inside the completion system, unless
that context has a more specific definition. It is best to avoid giving
the context as ‘<code>*</code>’ in case the style has some meaning outside the
completion system.</p>
<p>Many such general purpose styles can be configured simply by using the
<code>compinstall</code> function.</p>
<p>A more specific example of the use of the <code>verbose</code> style is by the
completion for the <code>kill</code> builtin. If the style is set, the builtin
lists full job texts and process command lines; otherwise it shows the
bare job numbers and PIDs. To turn the style off for this use only:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:*:kill:*:*' verbose no
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>For even more control, the style can use one of the tags ‘<code>jobs</code>’ or
‘<code>processes</code>’. To turn off verbose display only for jobs:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:*:kill:*:jobs' verbose no
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>-e</code> option to <code>zstyle</code> even allows completion function code to
appear as the argument to a style; this requires some understanding of
the internals of completion functions (see <a href="Completion-Widgets.html#Completion-Widgets">Completion
Widgets</a>)). For example,</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle -e ':completion:*' hosts 'reply=($myhosts)'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This forces the value of the <code>hosts</code> style to be read from the variable
<code>myhosts</code> each time a host name is needed; this is useful if the value
of <code>myhosts</code> can change dynamically. For another useful example, see the
example in the description of the <code>file-list</code> style below. This form can
be slow and should be avoided for commonly examined styles such as
<code>menu</code> and <code>list-rows-first</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the order in which styles are <em>defined</em> does not matter; the
style mechanism uses the most specific possible match for a particular
style to determine the set of values. More precisely, strings are
preferred over patterns (for example, ‘<code>:completion::complete:::foo</code>’ is
more specific than ‘<code>:completion::complete:::*’</code>), and longer patterns
are preferred over shorter patterns.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is that any completion style pattern that needs to
include more than one wildcard (<code>*</code>) and that does not end in a tag
name, should include all six colons (<code>:</code>), possibly surrounding
additional wildcards.</p>
<p>Style names like those of tags are arbitrary and depend on the
completion function. However, the following two sections list some of
the most common tags and styles.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Standard-Tags"></span></p>
<h3 id="2032-standard-tags"><a class="header" href="#2032-standard-tags">20.3.2 Standard Tags</a></h3>
<p><span id="index-completion-system_002c-tags"></span></p>

and do not refer to a type of match.</p>

<h3 id="2033-standard-styles"><a class="header" href="#2033-standard-styles">20.3.3 Standard Styles</a></h3>
<p><span id="index-completion-system_002c-styles"></span></p>
<p>Note that the values of several of these styles represent boolean
values. Any of the strings ‘<code>true</code>’, ‘<code>on</code>’, ‘<code>yes</code>’, and ‘<code>1</code>’ can be
used for the value ‘true’ and any of the strings ‘<code>false</code>’, ‘<code>off</code>’,
‘<code>no</code>’, and ‘<code>0</code>’ for the value ‘false’. The behavior for any other
value is undefined except where explicitly mentioned. The default value
may be either ‘true’ or ‘false’ if the style is not set.</p>
<p>Some of these styles are tested first for every possible tag
corresponding to a type of match, and if no style was found, for the
<code>list-colors</code> and styles controlling completion listing such as
<code>list-packed</code> and <code>last-prompt</code>. When tested for the <code>default</code> tag, only
the <code>function</code> field of the context will be set so that a style using
the <code>default</code> tag will normally be defined along the lines of:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:default' menu ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-accept_002dexact_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>accept-exact</code></p>
<p>This is tested for the <code>default</code> tag in addition to the tags valid for
the current context. If it is set to ‘true’ and any of the trial matches
is the same as the string on the command line, this match will
immediately be accepted (even if it would otherwise be considered
ambiguous).</p>
<p>When completing pathnames (where the tag used is ‘<code>paths</code>’) this style
accepts any number of patterns as the value in addition to the boolean
values. Pathnames matching one of these patterns will be accepted
immediately even if the command line contains some more partially typed
pathname components and these match no file under the directory
accepted.</p>
<p>This style is also used by the <code>_expand</code> completer to decide if words
beginning with a tilde or parameter expansion should be expanded. For
example, if there are parameters <code>foo</code> and <code>foobar</code>, the string ‘<code>$foo</code>’
will only be expanded if <code>accept-exact</code> is set to ‘true’; otherwise the
completion system will be allowed to complete <code>$foo</code> to <code>$foobar</code>. If
the style is set to ‘<code>continue</code>’, <code>_expand</code> will add the expansion as a
match and the completion system will also be allowed to continue.</p>
<p><span id="index-accept_002dexact_002ddirs_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>accept-exact-dirs</code></p>
<p>This is used by filename completion. Unlike <code>accept-exact</code> it is a
boolean. By default, filename completion examines all components of a
path to see if there are completions of that component, even if the
component matches an existing directory. For example, when completion
after <code>/usr/bin/</code>, the function examines possible completions to <code>/usr</code>.</p>
<p>When this style is ‘true’, any prefix of a path that matches an existing
directory is accepted without any attempt to complete it further. Hence,
in the given example, the path <code>/usr/bin/</code> is accepted immediately and
completion tried in that directory.</p>
<p>This style is also useful when completing after directories that
magically appear when referenced, such as ZFS <code>.zfs</code> directories or
NetApp <code>.snapshot</code> directories. When the style is set the shell does not
check for the existence of the directory within the parent directory.</p>
<p>If you wish to inhibit this behaviour entirely, set the
<code>path-completion</code> style (see below) to ‘false’.</p>
<p><span id="index-add_002dspace_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>add-space</code></p>
<p>This style is used by the <code>_expand</code> completer. If it is ‘true’ (the
default), a space will be inserted after all words resulting from the
expansion, or a slash in the case of directory names. If the value is
‘<code>file</code>’, the completer will only add a space to names of existing
files. Either a boolean ‘true’ or the value ‘<code>file</code>’ may be combined
with ‘<code>subst</code>’, in which case the completer will not add a space to
words generated from the expansion of a substitution of the form
‘<code>$(``...``)</code>’ or ‘<code>${``...``}</code>’.</p>
<p>The <code>_prefix</code> completer uses this style as a simple boolean value to
decide if a space should be inserted before the suffix.</p>
<p><span id="index-ambiguous_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>ambiguous</code></p>
<p>This applies when completing non-final components of filename paths, in
other words those with a trailing slash. If it is set, the cursor is
left after the first ambiguous component, even if menu completion is in
use. The style is always tested with the <code>paths</code> tag.</p>
<p><span id="index-assign_002dlist_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>assign-list</code></p>
<p>When completing after an equals sign that is being treated as an
assignment, the completion system normally completes only one filename.
In some cases the value may be a list of filenames separated by colons,
as with <code>PATH</code> and similar parameters. This style can be set to a list
of patterns matching the names of such parameters.</p>
<p>The default is to complete lists when the word on the line already
contains a colon.</p>
<p><span id="index-auto_002ddescription_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>auto-description</code></p>
<p>If set, this style’s value will be used as the description for options
that are not described by the completion functions, but that have
exactly one argument. The sequence ‘<code>%d</code>’ in the value will be replaced
by the description for this argument. Depending on personal preferences,
it may be useful to set this style to something like ‘<code>specify: %d</code>’.
Note that this may not work for some commands.</p>
<p><span id="index-avoid_002dcompleter_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>avoid-completer</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_all_matches</code> completer to decide if the string
consisting of all matches should be added to the list currently being
generated. Its value is a list of names of completers. If any of these
is the name of the completer that generated the matches in this
completion, the string will not be added.</p>
<p>The default value for this style is ‘<code>_expand _old_list _correct _approximate</code>’, i.e. it contains the completers for which a string with
all matches will almost never be wanted.</p>
<p><span id="index-cache_002dpath_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>cache-path</code></p>
<p>This style defines the path where any cache files containing dumped
completion data are stored. It defaults to ‘<code>$ZDOTDIR/.zcompcache</code>’, or
‘<code>$HOME/.zcompcache</code>’ if <code>$ZDOTDIR</code> is not defined. The completion
cache will not be used unless the <code>use-cache</code> style is set.</p>
<p><span id="index-cache_002dpolicy_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>cache-policy</code></p>
<p>This style defines the function that will be used to determine whether a
cache needs rebuilding. See the section on the <code>_cache_invalid</code> function
below.</p>
<p><span id="index-call_002dcommand_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>call-command</code></p>
<p>This style is used in the function for commands such as <code>make</code> and <code>ant</code>
where calling the command directly to generate matches suffers problems
such as being slow or, as in the case of <code>make</code> can potentially cause
actions in the makefile to be executed. If it is set to ‘true’ the
command is called to generate matches. The default value of this style
is ‘false’.</p>
<p><span id="index-command_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>command</code></p>
<p>In many places, completion functions need to call external commands to
generate the list of completions. This style can be used to override the
command that is called in some such cases. The elements of the value are
joined with spaces to form a command line to execute. The value can also
start with a hyphen, in which case the usual command will be added to
the end; this is most useful for putting ‘<code>builtin</code>’ or ‘<code>command</code>’ in
front to make sure the appropriate version of a command is called, for
example to avoid calling a shell function with the same name as an
external command.</p>
<p>As an example, the completion function for process IDs uses this style
with the <code>processes</code> tag to generate the IDs to complete and the list of
processes to display (if the <code>verbose</code> style is ‘true’). The list
produced by the command should look like the output of the <code>ps</code> command.
The first line is not displayed, but is searched for the string ‘<code>PID</code>’
(or ‘<code>pid</code>’) to find the position of the process IDs in the following
lines. If the line does not contain ‘<code>PID</code>’, the first numbers in each
of the other lines are taken as the process IDs to complete.</p>
<p>Note that the completion function generally has to call the specified
command for each attempt to generate the completion list. Hence care
should be taken to specify only commands that take a short time to run,
and in particular to avoid any that may never terminate.</p>
<p><span id="index-command_002dpath_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>command-path</code></p>
<p>This is a list of directories to search for commands to complete. The
default for this style is the value of the special parameter <code>path</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-commands_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>commands</code></p>
<p>This is used by the function completing sub-commands for the system
initialisation scripts (residing in <code>/etc/init.d</code> or somewhere not too
far away from that). Its values give the default commands to complete
for those commands for which the completion function isn’t able to find
them out automatically. The default for this style are the two strings
‘<code>start</code>’ and ‘<code>stop</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-complete_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>complete</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_expand_alias</code> function when invoked as a bindable
command. If set to ‘true’ and the word on the command line is not the
name of an alias, matching alias names will be completed.</p>
<p><span id="index-complete_002doptions_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>complete-options</code></p>
<p>This is used by the completer for <code>cd</code>, <code>chdir</code> and <code>pushd</code>. For these
commands a <code>-</code> is used to introduce a directory stack entry and
completion of these is far more common than completing options. Hence
unless the value of this style is ‘true’ options will not be completed,
even after an initial <code>-</code>. If it is ‘true’, options will be completed
after an initial <code>-</code> unless there is a preceding <code>-``-</code> on the command
line.</p>
<p><span id="index-completer_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>completer</code></p>
<p>The strings given as the value of this style provide the names of the
completer functions to use. The available completer functions are
described in <a href="#Control-Functions">Control Functions</a>.</p>
<p>Each string may be either the name of a completer function or a string
of the form ‘<code>function``:``name</code>’. In the first case the <code>completer</code>
field of the context will contain the name of the completer without the
leading underscore and with all other underscores replaced by hyphens.
In the second case the <code>function</code> is the name of the completer to call,
but the context will contain the user-defined <code>name</code> in the <code>completer</code>
field of the context. If the <code>name</code> starts with a hyphen, the string for
the context will be build from the name of the completer function as in
the first case with the <code>name</code> appended to it. For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _complete:-foo
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Here, completion will call the <code>_complete</code> completer twice, once using
‘<code>complete</code>’ and once using ‘<code>complete-foo</code>’ in the <code>completer</code> field
of the context. Normally, using the same completer more than once only
makes sense when used with the ‘<code>functions``:``name</code>’ form, because
otherwise the context name will be the same in all calls to the
completer; possible exceptions to this rule are the <code>_ignored</code> and
<code>_prefix</code> completers.</p>
<p>The default value for this style is ‘<code>_complete _ignored</code>’: only
completion will be done, first using the <code>ignored-patterns</code> style and
the <code>$fignore</code> array and then without ignoring matches.</p>
<p><span id="index-condition_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>condition</code></p>
<p>This style is used by the <code>_list</code> completer function to decide if
insertion of matches should be delayed unconditionally. The default is
‘true’.</p>
<p><span id="index-delimiters_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>delimiters</code></p>
<p>This style is used when adding a delimiter for use with history
modifiers or glob qualifiers that have delimited arguments. It is an
array of preferred delimiters to add. Non-special characters are
preferred as the completion system may otherwise become confused. The
default list is <code>:</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>%</code>. The list may be empty to force
a delimiter to be typed.</p>
<p><span id="index-disabled_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>disabled</code></p>
<p>If this is set to ‘true’, the <code>_expand_alias</code> completer and bindable
command will try to expand disabled aliases, too. The default is
‘false’.</p>
<p><span id="index-domains_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>domains</code></p>
<p>A list of names of network domains for completion. If this is not set,
domain names will be taken from the file <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-environ_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>environ</code></p>
<p>The environ style is used when completing for ‘<code>sudo</code>’. It is set to an
array of ‘<code>VAR``=``value</code>’ assignments to be exported into the local
environment before the completion for the target command is invoked.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:sudo::' environ \ 
  PATH=&quot;/sbin:/usr/sbin:$PATH&quot; HOME=&quot;/root&quot;
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-expand_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>expand</code></p>
<p>This style is used when completing strings consisting of multiple parts,
such as path names.</p>
<p>If one of its values is the string ‘<code>prefix</code>’, the partially typed word
from the line will be expanded as far as possible even if trailing parts
cannot be completed.</p>
<p>If one of its values is the string ‘<code>suffix</code>’, matching names for
components after the first ambiguous one will also be added. This means
that the resulting string is the longest unambiguous string possible.
However, menu completion can be used to cycle through all matches.</p>
<p><span id="index-fake_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>fake</code></p>
<p>This style may be set for any completion context. It specifies
additional strings that will always be completed in that context. The
form of each string is ‘<code>value``:``description</code>’; the colon and
description may be omitted, but any literal colons in <code>value</code> must be
quoted with a backslash. Any <code>description</code> provided is shown alongside
the value in completion listings.</p>
<p>It is important to use a sufficiently restrictive context when
specifying fake strings. Note that the styles <code>fake-files</code> and
<code>fake-parameters</code> provide additional features when completing files or
parameters.</p>
<p><span id="index-fake_002dalways_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>fake-always</code></p>
<p>This works identically to the <code>fake</code> style except that the
<code>ignored-patterns</code> style is not applied to it. This makes it possible to
override a set of matches completely by setting the ignored patterns to
‘<code>*</code>’.</p>
<p>The following shows a way of supplementing any tag with arbitrary data,
but having it behave for display purposes like a separate tag. In this
example we use the features of the <code>tag-order</code> style to divide the
<code>named-directories</code> tag into two when performing completion with the
standard completer <code>complete</code> for arguments of <code>cd</code>. The tag
<code>named-directories-normal</code> behaves as normal, but the tag
<code>named-directories-mine</code> contains a fixed set of directories. This has
the effect of adding the match group ‘<code>extra directories</code>’ with the
given completions.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion::complete:cd:*' tag-order \ 
  'named-directories:-mine:extra\ directories
  named-directories:-normal:named\ directories *'
zstyle ':completion::complete:cd:*:named-directories-mine' \ 
  fake-always mydir1 mydir2
zstyle ':completion::complete:cd:*:named-directories-mine' \ 
  ignored-patterns '*'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-fake_002dfiles_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>fake-files</code></p>
<p>This style is used when completing files and looked up without a tag.
Its values are of the form ‘<code>dir``:``names...</code>’. This will add the
<code>names</code> (strings separated by spaces) as possible matches when
completing in the directory <code>dir</code>, even if no such files really exist.
The dir may be a pattern; pattern characters or colons in <code>dir</code> should
be quoted with a backslash to be treated literally.</p>
<p>This can be useful on systems that support special file systems whose
top-level pathnames can not be listed or generated with glob patterns
(but see <code>accept-exact-dirs</code> for a more general way of dealing with this
problem). It can also be used for directories for which one does not
have read permission.</p>
<p>The pattern form can be used to add a certain ‘magic’ entry to all
directories on a particular file system.</p>
<p><span id="index-fake_002dparameters_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>fake-parameters</code></p>
<p>This is used by the completion function for parameter names. Its values
are names of parameters that might not yet be set but should be
completed nonetheless. Each name may also be followed by a colon and a
string specifying the type of the parameter (like ‘<code>scalar</code>’, ‘<code>array</code>’
or ‘<code>integer</code>’). If the type is given, the name will only be completed
if parameters of that type are required in the particular context. Names
for which no type is specified will always be completed.</p>
<p><span id="index-file_002dlist_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>file-list</code></p>
<p>This style controls whether files completed using the standard builtin
mechanism are to be listed with a long list similar to <code>ls -l</code>. Note
that this feature uses the shell module <code>zsh/stat</code> for file information;
this loads the builtin <code>stat</code> this the following code can be included in
an initialization file:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zmodload -i zsh/stat
disable stat
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The style may either be set to a ‘true’ value (or ‘<code>all</code>’), or one of
the values ‘<code>insert</code>’ or ‘<code>list</code>’, indicating that files are to be
listed in long format in all circumstances, or when attempting to insert
a file name, or when listing file names without attempting to insert
one.</p>
<p>More generally, the value may be an array of any of the above values,
optionally followed by <code>=``num</code>. If <code>num</code> is present it gives the
maximum number of matches for which long listing style will be used. For
example,</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' file-list list=20 insert=10
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>specifies that long format will be used when listing up to 20 files or
inserting a file with up to 10 matches (assuming a listing is to be
shown at all, for example on an ambiguous completion), else short format
will be used.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle -e ':completion:*' file-list \ 
       '(( ${+NUMERIC} )) &amp;&amp; reply=(true)'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>specifies that long format will be used any time a numeric argument is
supplied, else short format.</p>
<p><span id="index-file_002dpatterns_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>file-patterns</code></p>
<p>This is used by the standard function for completing filenames,
<code>_files</code>. If the style is unset up to three tags are offered,
‘<code>globbed-files</code>’,‘<code>directories</code>’ and ‘<code>all-files</code>’, depending on the
types of files expected by the caller of <code>_files</code>. The first two
(‘<code>globbed-files</code>’ and ‘<code>directories</code>’) are normally offered together
to make it easier to complete files in sub-directories.</p>
<p>The <code>file-patterns</code> style provides alternatives to the default tags,
which are not used. Its value consists of elements of the form
‘<code>pattern``:``tag</code>’; each string may contain any number of such
specifications separated by spaces.</p>
<p>The <code>pattern</code> is a pattern that is to be used to generate filenames. Any
occurrence of the sequence ‘<code>%p</code>’ is replaced by any pattern(s) passed
by the function calling <code>_files</code>. Colons in the pattern must be preceded
by a backslash to make them distinguishable from the colon before the
<code>tag</code>. If more than one pattern is needed, the patterns can be given
inside braces, separated by commas.</p>
<p>The <code>tag</code>s of all strings in the value will be offered by <code>_files</code> and
used when looking up other styles. Any <code>tag</code>s in the same word will be
offered at the same time and before later words. If no ‘<code>:``tag</code>’ is
given the ‘<code>files</code>’ tag will be used.</p>
<p>The <code>tag</code> may also be followed by an optional second colon and a
description, which will be used for the ‘<code>%d</code>’ in the value of the
<code>format</code> style (if that is set) instead of the default description
supplied by the completion function. If the description given here
contains itself a ‘<code>%d</code>’, that is replaced with the description supplied
by the completion function.</p>
<p>For example, to make the <code>rm</code> command first complete only names of
object files and then the names of all files if there is no matching
object file:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:*:rm:*:*' file-patterns \ 
    '*.o:object-files' '%p:all-files'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>To alter the default behaviour of file completion — offer files matching
a pattern and directories on the first attempt, then all files — to
offer only matching files on the first attempt, then directories, and
finally all files:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' file-patterns \ 
    '%p:globbed-files' '*(-/):directories' '*:all-files'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This works even where there is no special pattern: <code>_files</code> matches all
files using the pattern ‘<code>*</code>’ at the first step and stops when it sees
this pattern. Note also it will never try a pattern more than once for a
single completion attempt.</p>
<p>During the execution of completion functions, the <code>EXTENDED_GLOB</code> option
is in effect, so the characters ‘<code>#</code>’, ‘<code>~</code>’ and ‘<code>^</code>’ have special
meanings in the patterns.</p>
<p><span id="index-file_002dsort_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>file-sort</code></p>
<p>The standard filename completion function uses this style without a tag
to determine in which order the names should be listed; menu completion
will cycle through them in the same order. The possible values are:
‘<code>size</code>’ to sort by the size of the file; ‘<code>links</code>’ to sort by the
number of links to the file; ‘<code>modification</code>’ (or ‘<code>time</code>’ or ‘<code>date</code>’)
to sort by the last modification time; ‘<code>access</code>’ to sort by the last
access time; and ‘<code>inode</code>’ (or ‘<code>change</code>’) to sort by the last inode
change time. If the style is set to any other value, or is unset, files
will be sorted alphabetically by name. If the value contains the string
‘<code>reverse</code>’, sorting is done in the opposite order. If the value
contains the string ‘<code>follow</code>’, timestamps are associated with the
targets of symbolic links; the default is to use the timestamps of the
links themselves.</p>
<p><span id="index-file_002dsplit_002dchars_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>file-split-chars</code></p>
<p>A set of characters that will cause <em>all</em> file completions for the given
context to be split at the point where any of the characters occurs. A
typical use is to set the style to <code>:</code>; then everything up to and
including the last <code>:</code> in the string so far is ignored when completing
files. As this is quite heavy-handed, it is usually preferable to update
completion functions for contexts where this behaviour is useful.</p>
<p><span id="index-filter_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>filter</code></p>
<p>The <code>ldap</code> plugin of email address completion (see <code>_email_addresses</code>)
uses this style to specify the attributes to match against when
filtering entries. So for example, if the style is set to ‘<code>sn</code>’,
matching is done against surnames. Standard LDAP filtering is used so
normal completion matching is bypassed. If this style is not set, the
LDAP plugin is skipped. You may also need to set the <code>command</code> style to
specify how to connect to your LDAP server.</p>
<p><span id="index-force_002dlist_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>force-list</code></p>
<p>This forces a list of completions to be shown at any point where listing
is done, even in cases where the list would usually be suppressed. For
example, normally the list is only shown if there are at least two
different matches. By setting this style to ‘<code>always</code>’, the list will
always be shown, even if there is only a single match that will
immediately be accepted. The style may also be set to a number. In this
case the list will be shown if there are at least that many matches,
even if they would all insert the same string.</p>
<p>This style is tested for the default tag as well as for each tag valid
for the current completion. Hence the listing can be forced only for
certain types of match.</p>
<p><span id="index-format_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>format</code></p>
<p>If this is set for the <code>descriptions</code> tag, its value is used as a string
to display above matches in completion lists. The sequence ‘<code>%d</code>’ in
this string will be replaced with a short description of what these
matches are. This string may also contain the output attribute sequences
understood by <code>compadd -X</code> (see <a href="Completion-Widgets.html#Completion-Widgets">Completion
Widgets</a>).</p>
<p>The style is tested with each tag valid for the current completion
before it is tested for the <code>descriptions</code> tag. Hence different format
strings can be defined for different types of match.</p>
<p>Note also that some completer functions define additional
‘<code>%</code>’-sequences. These are described for the completer functions
that make use of them.</p>
<p>Some completion functions display messages that may be customised by
setting this style for the <code>messages</code> tag. Here, the ‘<code>%d</code>’ is replaced
with a message given by the completion function.</p>
<p>Finally, the format string is looked up with the <code>warnings</code> tag, for use
when no matches could be generated at all. In this case the ‘<code>%d</code>’ is
replaced with the descriptions for the matches that were expected
separated by spaces. The sequence ‘<code>%D</code>’ is replaced with the same
descriptions separated by newlines.</p>
<p>It is possible to use printf-style field width specifiers with ‘<code>%d</code>’
and similar escape sequences. This is handled by the <code>zformat</code> builtin
command from the <code>zsh/zutil</code> module, see <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fzutil-Module">The zsh/zutil
Module</a>.</p>
<p><span id="index-glob_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>glob</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_expand</code> completer. If it is set to ‘true’ (the
default), globbing will be attempted on the words resulting from a
previous substitution (see the <code>substitute</code> style) or else the original
string from the line.</p>
<p><span id="index-global_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>global</code></p>
<p>If this is set to ‘true’ (the default), the <code>_expand_alias</code> completer
and bindable command will try to expand global aliases.</p>
<p><span id="index-group_002dname_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>group-name</code></p>
<p>The completion system can group different types of matches, which appear
in separate lists. This style can be used to give the names of groups
for particular tags. For example, in command position the completion
system generates names of builtin and external commands, names of
aliases, shell functions and parameters and reserved words as possible
completions. To have the external commands and shell functions listed
separately:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:*:-command-:*:commands' \ 
       group-name commands
zstyle ':completion:*:*:-command-:*:functions' \ 
       group-name functions
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>As a consequence, any match with the same tag will be displayed in the
same group.</p>
<p>If the name given is the empty string the name of the tag for the
matches will be used as the name of the group. So, to have all different
types of matches displayed separately, one can just set:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' group-name ''
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>All matches for which no group name is defined will be put in a group
named <code>-default-</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-group_002dorder_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>group-order</code></p>
<p>This style is additional to the <code>group-name</code> style to specify the order
for display of the groups defined by that style (compare <code>tag-order</code>,
which determines which completions appear at all). The groups named are
shown in the given order; any other groups are shown in the order
defined by the completion function.</p>
<p>For example, to have names of builtin commands, shell functions and
external commands appear in that order when completing in command
position:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:*:-command-:*:*' group-order \ 
       builtins functions commands
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-groups_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>groups</code></p>
<p>A list of names of UNIX groups. If this is not set, group names are
taken from the YP database or the file ‘<code>/etc/group</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-hidden_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>hidden</code></p>
<p>If this is set to ‘true’, matches for the given context will not be
listed, although any description for the matches set with the <code>format</code>
style will be shown. If it is set to ‘<code>all</code>’, not even the description
will be displayed.</p>
<p>Note that the matches will still be completed; they are just not shown
in the list. To avoid having matches considered as possible completions
at all, the <code>tag-order</code> style can be modified as described below.</p>
<p><span id="index-hosts_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>hosts</code></p>
<p>A list of names of hosts that should be completed. If this is not set,
hostnames are taken from the file ‘<code>/etc/hosts</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-hosts_002dports_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>hosts-ports</code></p>
<p>This style is used by commands that need or accept hostnames and network
ports. The strings in the value should be of the form ‘<code>host``:``port</code>’.
Valid ports are determined by the presence of hostnames; multiple ports
for the same host may appear.</p>
<p><span id="index-ignore_002dline_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>ignore-line</code></p>
<p>This is tested for each tag valid for the current completion. If it is
set to ‘true’, none of the words that are already on the line will be
considered as possible completions. If it is set to ‘<code>current</code>’, the
word the cursor is on will not be considered as a possible completion.
The value ‘<code>current-shown</code>’ is similar but only applies if the list of
completions is currently shown on the screen. Finally, if the style is
set to ‘<code>other</code>’, all words on the line except for the current one will
be excluded from the possible completions.</p>
<p>The values ‘<code>current</code>’ and ‘<code>current-shown</code>’ are a bit like the opposite
of the <code>accept-exact</code> style: only strings with missing characters will
be completed.</p>
<p>Note that you almost certainly don’t want to set this to ‘true’ or
‘<code>other</code>’ for a general context such as ‘<code>:completion:*</code>’. This is
because it would disallow completion of, for example, options multiple
times even if the command in question accepts the option more than once.</p>
<p><span id="index-ignore_002dparents_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>ignore-parents</code></p>
<p>The style is tested without a tag by the function completing pathnames
in order to determine whether to ignore the names of directories already
mentioned in the current word, or the name of the current working
directory. The value must include one or both of the following strings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>parent</code><br />
The name of any directory whose path is already contained in the
word on the line is ignored. For example, when completing after
<code>foo/../</code>, the directory <code>foo</code> will not be considered a valid
completion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pwd</code><br />
The name of the current working directory will not be completed;
hence, for example, completion after <code>../</code> will not use the name of
the current directory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the value may include one or both of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>..</code><br />
Ignore the specified directories only when the word on the line
contains the substring ‘<code>../</code>’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>directory</code><br />
Ignore the specified directories only when names of directories are
completed, not when completing names of files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Excluded values act in a similar fashion to values of the
<code>ignored-patterns</code> style, so they can be restored to consideration by
the <code>_ignored</code> completer.</p>
<p><span id="index-extra_002dverbose_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>extra-verbose</code></p>
<p>If set, the completion listing is more verbose at the cost of a probable
decrease in completion speed. Completion performance will suffer if this
style is set to ‘true’.</p>
<p><span id="index-ignored_002dpatterns_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>ignored-patterns</code></p>
<p>A list of patterns; any trial completion matching one of the patterns
will be excluded from consideration. The <code>_ignored</code> completer can appear
in the list of completers to restore the ignored matches. This is a more
configurable version of the shell parameter <code>$fignore</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>EXTENDED_GLOB</code> option is set during the execution of
completion functions, so the characters ‘<code>#</code>’, ‘<code>~</code>’ and ‘<code>^</code>’ have
special meanings in the patterns.</p>
<p><span id="index-insert_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>insert</code></p>
<p>This style is used by the <code>_all_matches</code> completer to decide whether to
insert the list of all matches unconditionally instead of adding the
list as another match.</p>
<p><span id="index-insert_002dids_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>insert-ids</code></p>
<p>When completing process IDs, for example as arguments to the <code>kill</code> and
<code>wait</code> builtins the name of a command may be converted to the
appropriate process ID. A problem arises when the process name typed is
not unique. By default (or if this style is set explicitly to ‘<code>menu</code>’)
the name will be converted immediately to a set of possible IDs, and
menu completion will be started to cycle through them.</p>
<p>If the value of the style is ‘<code>single</code>’, the shell will wait until the
user has typed enough to make the command unique before converting the
name to an ID; attempts at completion will be unsuccessful until that
point. If the value is any other string, menu completion will be started
when the string typed by the user is longer than the common prefix to
the corresponding IDs.</p>
<p><span id="index-insert_002dtab_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>insert-tab</code></p>
<p>If this is set to ‘true’, the completion system will insert a TAB
character (assuming that was used to start completion) instead of
performing completion when there is no non-blank character to the left
of the cursor. If it is set to ‘false’, completion will be done even
there.</p>
<p>The value may also contain the substrings ‘<code>pending</code>’ or
‘<code>pending=``val</code>’. In this case, the typed character will be inserted
instead of starting completion when there is unprocessed input pending.
If a <code>val</code> is given, completion will not be done if there are at least
that many characters of unprocessed input. This is often useful when
pasting characters into a terminal. Note however, that it relies on the
<code>$PENDING</code> special parameter from the <code>zsh/zle</code> module being set
properly which is not guaranteed on all platforms.</p>
<p>The default value of this style is ‘true’ except for completion within
<code>vared</code> builtin command where it is ‘false’.</p>
<p><span id="index-insert_002dunambiguous_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>insert-unambiguous</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_match</code> and <code>_approximate</code> completers. These
completers are often used with menu completion since the word typed may
bear little resemblance to the final completion. However, if this style
is ‘true’, the completer will start menu completion only if it could
find no unambiguous initial string at least as long as the original
string typed by the user.</p>
<p>In the case of the <code>_approximate</code> completer, the completer field in the
context will already have been set to one of <code>correct-``num</code> or
<code>approximate-``num</code>, where <code>num</code> is the number of errors that were
accepted.</p>
<p>In the case of the <code>_match</code> completer, the style may also be set to the
string ‘<code>pattern</code>’. Then the pattern on the line is left unchanged if it
does not match unambiguously.</p>
<p><span id="index-gain_002dprivileges_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>gain-privileges</code></p>
<p>If set to <code>true</code>, this style enables the use of commands like <code>sudo</code> or
<code>doas</code> to gain extra privileges when retrieving information for
completion. This is only done when a command such as <code>sudo</code> appears on
the command-line. To force the use of, e.g. <code>sudo</code> or to override any
prefix that might be added due to <code>gain-privileges</code>, the <code>command</code> style
can be used with a value that begins with a hyphen.</p>
<p><span id="index-keep_002dprefix_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>keep-prefix</code></p>
<p>This style is used by the <code>_expand</code> completer. If it is ‘true’, the
completer will try to keep a prefix containing a tilde or parameter
expansion. Hence, for example, the string ‘<code>~/f*</code>’ would be expanded to
‘<code>~/foo</code>’ instead of ‘<code>/home/user/foo</code>’. If the style is set to
‘<code>changed</code>’ (the default), the prefix will only be left unchanged if
there were other changes between the expanded words and the original
word from the command line. Any other value forces the prefix to be
expanded unconditionally.</p>
<p>The behaviour of <code>_expand</code> when this style is ‘true’ is to cause
<code>_expand</code> to give up when a single expansion with the restored prefix is
the same as the original; hence any remaining completers may be called.</p>
<p><span id="index-last_002dprompt_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>last-prompt</code></p>
<p>This is a more flexible form of the <code>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</code> option. If it
is ‘true’, the completion system will try to return the cursor to the
previous command line after displaying a completion list. It is tested
for all tags valid for the current completion, then the <code>default</code> tag.
The cursor will be moved back to the previous line if this style is
‘true’ for all types of match. Note that unlike the
<code>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</code> option this is independent of the numeric argument.</p>
<p><span id="index-known_002dhosts_002dfiles"></span></p>
<p><code>known-hosts-files</code></p>
<p>This style should contain a list of files to search for host names and
(if the <code>use-ip</code> style is set) IP addresses in a format compatible with
ssh <code>known_hosts</code> files. If it is not set, the files
<code>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</code> and <code>~/.ssh/known_hosts</code> are used.</p>
<p><span id="index-list_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>list</code></p>
<p>This style is used by the <code>_history_complete_word</code> bindable command. If
it is set to ‘true’ it has no effect. If it is set to ‘false’ matches
will not be listed. This overrides the setting of the options
controlling listing behaviour, in particular <code>AUTO_LIST</code>. The context
always starts with ‘<code>:completion:history-words</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-list_002dcolors_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>list-colors</code></p>
<p>If the <code>zsh/complist</code> module is loaded, this style can be used to set
color specifications. This mechanism replaces the use of the
<code>ZLS_COLORS</code> and <code>ZLS_COLOURS</code> parameters described in <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fcomplist-Module">The zsh/complist
Module</a>, but the syntax is
the same.</p>
<p>If this style is set for the <code>default</code> tag, the strings in the value are
taken as specifications that are to be used everywhere. If it is set for
other tags, the specifications are used only for matches of the type
described by the tag. For this to work best, the <code>group-name</code> style must
be set to an empty string.</p>
<p>In addition to setting styles for specific tags, it is also possible to
use group names specified explicitly by the <code>group-name</code> tag together
with the ‘<code>(group)</code>’ syntax allowed by the <code>ZLS_COLORS</code> and
<code>ZLS_COLOURS</code> parameters and simply using the <code>default</code> tag.</p>
<p>It is possible to use any color specifications already set up for the
GNU version of the <code>ls</code> command:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:default' list-colors \ 
       ${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The default colors are the same as for the GNU <code>ls</code> command and can be
obtained by setting the style to an empty string (i.e. <code>’’</code>).</p>
<p><span id="index-list_002ddirs_002dfirst_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>list-dirs-first</code></p>
<p>This is used by file completion. If set, directories to be completed are
listed separately from and before completion for other files, regardless
of tag ordering. In addition, the tag <code>other-files</code> is used in place of
<code>all-files</code> for the remaining files, to indicate that no directories are
presented with that tag.</p>
<p><span id="index-list_002dgrouped_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>list-grouped</code></p>
<p>If this style is ‘true’ (the default), the completion system will try to
make certain completion listings more compact by grouping matches. For
example, options for commands that have the same description (shown when
the <code>verbose</code> style is set to ‘true’) will appear as a single entry.
However, menu selection can be used to cycle through all the matches.</p>
<p><span id="index-list_002dpacked_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>list-packed</code></p>
<p>This is tested for each tag valid in the current context as well as the
<code>default</code> tag. If it is set to ‘true’, the corresponding matches appear
in listings as if the <code>LIST_PACKED</code> option were set. If it is set to
‘false’, they are listed normally.</p>
<p><span id="index-list_002dprompt_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>list-prompt</code></p>
<p>If this style is set for the <code>default</code> tag, completion lists that don’t
fit on the screen can be scrolled (see <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fcomplist-Module">The zsh/complist
Module</a>). The value, if
not the empty string, will be displayed after every screenful and the
shell will prompt for a key press; if the style is set to the empty
string, a default prompt will be used.</p>
<p>The value may contain the escape sequences: ‘<code>%l</code>’ or ‘<code>%L</code>’, which will
be replaced by the number of the last line displayed and the total
number of lines; ‘<code>%m</code>’ or ‘<code>%M</code>’, the number of the last match shown
and the total number of matches; and ‘<code>%p</code>’ and ‘<code>%P</code>’, ‘<code>Top</code>’ when at
the beginning of the list, ‘<code>Bottom</code>’ when at the end and the position
shown as a percentage of the total length otherwise. In each case the
form with the uppercase letter will be replaced by a string of fixed
width, padded to the right with spaces, while the lowercase form will be
replaced by a variable width string. As in other prompt strings, the
escape sequences ‘<code>%S</code>’, ‘<code>%s</code>’, ‘<code>%B</code>’, ‘<code>%b</code>’, ‘<code>%U</code>’, ‘<code>%u</code>’ for
entering and leaving the display modes standout, bold and underline, and
‘<code>%F</code>’, ‘<code>%f</code>’, ‘<code>%K</code>’, ‘<code>%k</code>’ for changing the foreground background
colour, are also available, as is the form ‘<code>%{</code>...<code>%}</code>’ for enclosing
escape sequences which display with zero (or, with a numeric argument,
some other) width.</p>
<p>After deleting this prompt the variable <code>LISTPROMPT</code> should be unset for
the removal to take effect.</p>
<p><span id="index-list_002drows_002dfirst_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>list-rows-first</code></p>
<p>This style is tested in the same way as the <code>list-packed</code> style and
determines whether matches are to be listed in a rows-first fashion as
if the <code>LIST_ROWS_FIRST</code> option were set.</p>
<p><span id="index-list_002dsuffixes_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>list-suffixes</code></p>
<p>This style is used by the function that completes filenames. If it is
‘true’, and completion is attempted on a string containing multiple
partially typed pathname components, all ambiguous components will be
shown. Otherwise, completion stops at the first ambiguous component.</p>
<p><span id="index-list_002dseparator_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>list-separator</code></p>
<p>The value of this style is used in completion listing to separate the
string to complete from a description when possible (e.g. when
completing options). It defaults to ‘<code>-``-</code>’ (two hyphens).</p>
<p><span id="index-local_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>local</code></p>
<p>This is for use with functions that complete URLs for which the
corresponding files are available directly from the file system. Its
value should consist of three strings: a hostname, the path to the
default web pages for the server, and the directory name used by a user
placing web pages within their home area.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' local toast \ 
    /var/http/public/toast public_html
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Completion after ‘<code>http://toast/stuff/</code>’ will look for files in the
directory <code>/var/http/public/toast/stuff</code>, while completion after
‘<code>http://toast/~yousir/</code>’ will look for files in the directory
<code>~yousir/public_html</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-mail_002ddirectory_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>mail-directory</code></p>
<p>If set, zsh will assume that mailbox files can be found in the directory
specified. It defaults to ‘<code>~/Mail</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-match_002doriginal_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>match-original</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_match</code> completer. If it is set to <code>only</code>, <code>_match</code>
will try to generate matches without inserting a ‘<code>*</code>’ at the cursor
position. If set to any other non-empty value, it will first try to
generate matches without inserting the ‘<code>*</code>’ and if that yields no
matches, it will try again with the ‘<code>*</code>’ inserted. If it is unset or
set to the empty string, matching will only be performed with the ‘<code>*</code>’
inserted.</p>
<p><span id="index-matcher_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>matcher</code></p>
<p>This style is tested separately for each tag valid in the current
context. Its value is placed before any match specifications given by
the <code>matcher-list</code> style so can override them via the use of an <code>x:</code>
specification. The value should be in the form described in <a href="Completion-Widgets.html#Completion-Matching-Control">Completion
Matching Control</a>.
For examples of this, see the description of the <code>tag-order</code> style.</p>
<p>For notes comparing the use of this and the <code>matcher-list</code> style, see
under the description of the <code>tag-order</code> style.</p>
<p><span id="index-matcher_002dlist_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>matcher-list</code></p>
<p>This style can be set to a list of match specifications that are to be
applied everywhere. Match specifications are described in <a href="Completion-Widgets.html#Completion-Matching-Control">Completion
Matching Control</a>.
The completion system will try them one after another for each completer
selected. For example, to try first simple completion and, if that
generates no matches, case-insensitive completion:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list '' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>By default each specification replaces the previous one; however, if a
specification is prefixed with <code>+</code>, it is added to the existing list.
Hence it is possible to create increasingly general specifications
without repetition:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list \ 
       '' '+m:{a-z}={A-Z}' '+m:{A-Z}={a-z}'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>It is possible to create match specifications valid for particular
completers by using the third field of the context. This applies only to
completers that override the global matcher-list, which as of this
writing includes only <code>_prefix</code> and <code>_ignored</code>. For example, to use the
completers <code>_complete</code> and <code>_prefix</code> but allow case-insensitive
completion only with <code>_complete</code>:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _prefix
zstyle ':completion:*:complete:*:*:*' matcher-list \ 
       '' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>User-defined names, as explained for the <code>completer</code> style, are
available. This makes it possible to try the same completer more than
once with different match specifications each time. For example, to try
normal completion without a match specification, then normal completion
with case-insensitive matching, then correction, and finally
partial-word completion:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' completer \ 
    _complete _correct _complete:foo
zstyle ':completion:*:complete:*:*:*' matcher-list \ 
    '' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'
zstyle ':completion:*:foo:*:*:*' matcher-list \ 
    'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z} r:|[-_./]=* r:|=*'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If the style is unset in any context no match specification is applied.
Note also that some completers such as <code>_correct</code> and <code>_approximate</code> do
not use the match specifications at all, though these completers will
only ever be called once even if the <code>matcher-list</code> contains more than
one element.</p>
<p>Where multiple specifications are useful, note that the <em>entire</em>
completion is done for each element of <code>matcher-list</code>, which can quickly
reduce the shell’s performance. As a rough rule of thumb, hand, putting
multiple space-separated values into the same string does not have an
appreciable impact on performance.</p>
<p>If there is no current matcher or it is empty, and the option
<code>NO_CASE_GLOB</code> is in effect, the matching for files is performed
case-insensitively in any case. However, any matcher must explicitly
specify case-insensitive matching if that is required.</p>
<p>For notes comparing the use of this and the <code>matcher</code> style, see under
the description of the <code>tag-order</code> style.</p>
<p><span id="index-max_002derrors_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>max-errors</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_approximate</code> and <code>_correct</code> completer functions to
determine the maximum number of errors to allow. The completer will try
to generate completions by first allowing one error, then two errors,
and so on, until either a match or matches were found or the maximum
number of errors given by this style has been reached.</p>
<p>If the value for this style contains the string ‘<code>numeric</code>’, the
completer function will take any numeric argument as the maximum number
of errors allowed. For example, with</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:approximate:::' max-errors 2 numeric
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>two errors are allowed if no numeric argument is given, but with a
numeric argument of six (as in ‘<code>ESC-6 TAB</code>’), up to six errors are
accepted. Hence with a value of ‘<code>0 numeric</code>’, no correcting completion
will be attempted unless a numeric argument is given.</p>
<p>If the value contains the string ‘<code>not-numeric</code>’, the completer will
<em>not</em> try to generate corrected completions when given a numeric
argument, so in this case the number given should be greater than zero.
For example, ‘<code>2 not-numeric</code>’ specifies that correcting completion with
two errors will usually be performed, but if a numeric argument is
given, correcting completion will not be performed.</p>
<p>The default value for this style is ‘<code>2 numeric</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-max_002dmatches_002dwidth_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>max-matches-width</code></p>
<p>This style is used to determine the trade off between the width of the
display used for matches and the width used for their descriptions when
the <code>verbose</code> style is in effect. The value gives the number of display
columns to reserve for the matches. The default is half the width of the
screen.</p>
<p>This has the most impact when several matches have the same description
and so will be grouped together. Increasing the style will allow more
matches to be grouped together; decreasing it will allow more of the
description to be visible.</p>
<p><span id="index-menu_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>menu</code></p>
<p>If this is ‘true’ in the context of any of the tags defined for the
current completion menu completion will be used. The value for a
specific tag will take precedence over that for the ‘<code>default</code>’ tag.</p>
<p>If none of the values found in this way is ‘true’ but at least one is
set to ‘<code>auto</code>’, the shell behaves as if the <code>AUTO_MENU</code> option is set.</p>
<p>If one of the values is explicitly set to ‘false’, menu completion will
be explicitly turned off, overriding the <code>MENU_COMPLETE</code> option and
other settings.</p>
<p>In the form ‘<code>yes=``num</code>’, where ‘<code>yes</code>’ may be any of the ‘true’ values
(‘<code>yes</code>’, ‘<code>true</code>’, ‘<code>on</code>’ and ‘<code>1</code>’), menu completion will be turned on
if there are at least <code>num</code> matches. In the form ‘<code>yes=long</code>’, menu
completion will be turned on if the list does not fit on the screen.
This does not activate menu completion if the widget normally only lists
completions, but menu completion can be activated in that case with the
value ‘<code>yes=long-list</code>’ (Typically, the value ‘<code>select=long-list</code>’
described later is more useful as it provides control over scrolling.)</p>
<p>Similarly, with any of the ‘false’ values (as in ‘<code>no=10</code>’), menu
completion will <em>not</em> be used if there are <code>num</code> or more matches.</p>
<p>The value of this widget also controls menu selection, as implemented by
the <code>zsh/complist</code> module. The following values may appear either
alongside or instead of the values above.</p>
<p>If the value contains the string ‘<code>select</code>’, menu selection will be
started unconditionally.</p>
<p>In the form ‘<code>select=``num</code>’, menu selection will only be started if
there are at least <code>num</code> matches. If the values for more than one tag
provide a number, the smallest number is taken.</p>
<p>Menu selection can be turned off explicitly by defining a value
containing the string‘<code>no-select</code>’.</p>
<p>It is also possible to start menu selection only if the list of matches
does not fit on the screen by using the value ‘<code>select=long</code>’. To start
menu selection even if the current widget only performs listing, use the
value ‘<code>select=long-list</code>’.</p>
<p>To turn on menu completion or menu selection when there are a certain
number of matches <em>or</em> the list of matches does not fit on the screen,
both of ‘<code>yes=</code>’ and ‘<code>select=</code>’ may be given twice, once with a number
and once with ‘<code>long</code>’ or ‘<code>long-list</code>’.</p>
<p>Finally, it is possible to activate two special modes of menu selection.
The word ‘<code>interactive</code>’ in the value causes interactive mode to be
entered immediately when menu selection is started; see <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fcomplist-Module">The
zsh/complist Module</a> for a
description of interactive mode. Including the string ‘<code>search</code>’ does
the same for incremental search mode. To select backward incremental
search, include the string ‘<code>search-backward</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-muttrc_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>muttrc</code></p>
<p>If set, gives the location of the mutt configuration file. It defaults
to ‘<code>~/.muttrc</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-numbers_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>numbers</code></p>
<p>This is used with the <code>jobs</code> tag. If it is ‘true’, the shell will
complete job numbers instead of the shortest unambiguous prefix of the
job command text. If the value is a number, job numbers will only be
used if that many words from the job descriptions are required to
resolve ambiguities. For example, if the value is ‘<code>1</code>’, strings will
only be used if all jobs differ in the first word on their command
lines.</p>
<p><span id="index-old_002dlist_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>old-list</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_oldlist</code> completer. If it is set to ‘<code>always</code>’,
then standard widgets which perform listing will retain the current list
of matches, however they were generated; this can be turned off
explicitly with the value ‘<code>never</code>’, giving the behaviour without the
<code>_oldlist</code> completer. If the style is unset, or any other value, then
the existing list of completions is displayed if it is not already;
otherwise, the standard completion list is generated; this is the
default behaviour of <code>_oldlist</code>. However, if there is an old list and
this style contains the name of the completer function that generated
the list, then the old list will be used even if it was generated by a
widget which does not do listing.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you type <code>^Xc</code> to use the <code>_correct_word</code> widget,
which generates a list of corrections for the word under the cursor.
Usually, typing <code>^D</code> would generate a standard list of completions for
the word on the command line, and show that. With <code>_oldlist</code>, it will
instead show the list of corrections already generated.</p>
<p>As another example consider the <code>_match</code> completer: with the
<code>insert-unambiguous</code> style set to ‘true’ it inserts only a common prefix
string, if there is any. However, this may remove parts of the original
pattern, so that further completion could produce more matches than on
the first attempt. By using the <code>_oldlist</code> completer and setting this
style to <code>_match</code>, the list of matches generated on the first attempt
will be used again.</p>
<p><span id="index-old_002dmatches_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>old-matches</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_all_matches</code> completer to decide if an old list of
matches should be used if one exists. This is selected by one of the
‘true’ values or by the string ‘<code>only</code>’. If the value is ‘<code>only</code>’,
<code>_all_matches</code> will only use an old list and won’t have any effect on
the list of matches currently being generated.</p>
<p>If this style is set it is generally unwise to call the <code>_all_matches</code>
completer unconditionally. One possible use is for either this style or
the <code>completer</code> style to be defined with the <code>-e</code> option to <code>zstyle</code> to
make the style conditional.</p>
<p><span id="index-old_002dmenu_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>old-menu</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_oldlist</code> completer. It controls how menu
completion behaves when a completion has already been inserted and the
user types a standard completion key such as <code>TAB</code>. The default
behaviour of <code>_oldlist</code> is that menu completion always continues with
the existing list of completions. If this style is set to ‘false’,
however, a new completion is started if the old list was generated by a
different completion command; this is the behaviour without the
<code>_oldlist</code> completer.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you type <code>^Xc</code> to generate a list of corrections,
and menu completion is started in one of the usual ways. Usually, or
with this style set to ‘false’, typing <code>TAB</code> at this point would start
trying to complete the line as it now appears. With <code>_oldlist</code>, it
instead continues to cycle through the list of corrections.</p>
<p><span id="index-original_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>original</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_approximate</code> and <code>_correct</code> completers to decide
if the original string should be added as a possible completion.
Normally, this is done only if there are at least two possible
corrections, but if this style is set to ‘true’, it is always added.
Note that the style will be examined with the completer field in the
context name set to <code>correct-``num</code> or <code>approximate-``num</code>, where <code>num</code>
is the number of errors that were accepted.</p>
<p><span id="index-packageset_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>packageset</code></p>
<p>This style is used when completing arguments of the Debian ‘<code>dpkg</code>’
program. It contains an override for the default package set for a given
context. For example,</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:complete:dpkg:option--status-1:*' \ 
               packageset avail
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>causes available packages, rather than only installed packages, to be
completed for ‘<code>dpkg -``-status</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-path_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>path</code></p>
<p>The function that completes color names uses this style with the
<code>colors</code> tag. The value should be the pathname of a file containing
color names in the format of an X11 <code>rgb.txt</code> file. If the style is not
set but this file is found in one of various standard locations it will
be used as the default.</p>
<p><span id="index-path_002dcompletion_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>path-completion</code></p>
<p>This is used by filename completion. By default, filename completion
examines all components of a path to see if there are completions of
that component. For example, <code>/u/b/z</code> can be completed to
<code>/usr/bin/zsh</code>. Explicitly setting this style to ‘false’ inhibits this
behaviour for path components up to the <code>/</code> before the cursor; this
overrides the setting of <code>accept-exact-dirs</code>.</p>
<p>Even with the style set to ‘false’, it is still possible to complete
multiple paths by setting the option <code>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</code> and moving the
cursor back to the first component in the path to be completed. For
example, <code>/u/b/z</code> can be completed to <code>/usr/bin/zsh</code> if the cursor is
after the <code>/u</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-pine_002ddirectory_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>pine-directory</code></p>
<p>If set, specifies the directory containing PINE mailbox files. There is
no default, since recursively searching this directory is inconvenient
for anyone who doesn’t use PINE.</p>
<p><span id="index-ports_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>ports</code></p>
<p>A list of Internet service names (network ports) to complete. If this is
not set, service names are taken from the file ‘<code>/etc/services</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-prefix_002dhidden_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>prefix-hidden</code></p>
<p>This is used for certain completions which share a common prefix, for
example command options beginning with dashes. If it is ‘true’, the
prefix will not be shown in the list of matches.</p>
<p>The default value for this style is ‘false’.</p>
<p><span id="index-prefix_002dneeded_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>prefix-needed</code></p>
<p>This style is also relevant for matches with a common prefix. If it is
set to ‘true’ this common prefix must be typed by the user to generate
the matches.</p>
<p>The style is applicable to the <code>options</code>, <code>signals</code>, <code>jobs</code>,
<code>functions</code>, and <code>parameters</code> completion tags.</p>
<p>For command options, this means that the initial ‘<code>-</code>’, ‘<code>+</code>’, or
‘<code>-``-</code>’ must be typed explicitly before option names will be
completed.</p>
<p>For signals, an initial ‘<code>-</code>’ is required before signal names will be
completed.</p>
<p>For jobs, an initial ‘<code>%</code>’ is required before job names will be
completed.</p>
<p>For function and parameter names, an initial ‘<code>_</code>’ or ‘<code>.</code>’ is required
before function or parameter names starting with those characters will
be completed.</p>
<p>The default value for this style is ‘false’ for <code>function</code> and
<code>parameter</code> completions, and ‘true’ otherwise.</p>
<p><span id="index-preserve_002dprefix_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>preserve-prefix</code></p>
<p>This style is used when completing path names. Its value should be a
pattern matching an initial prefix of the word to complete that should
be left unchanged under all circumstances. For example, on some Unices
an initial ‘<code>//</code>’ (double slash) has a special meaning; setting this
style to the string ‘<code>//</code>’ will preserve it. As another example, setting
this style to ‘<code>?:/</code>’ under Cygwin would allow completion after
‘<code>a:/...</code>’ and so on.</p>
<p><span id="index-range_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>range</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_history</code> completer and the
<code>_history_complete_word</code> bindable command to decide which words should
be completed.</p>
<p>If it is a single number, only the last <code>N</code> words from the history will
be completed.</p>
<p>If it is a range of the form ‘<code>max``:``slice</code>’, the last <code>slice</code> words
will be completed; then if that yields no matches, the <code>slice</code> words
before those will be tried and so on. This process stops either when at
least one match has been found, or <code>max</code> words have been tried.</p>
<p>The default is to complete all words from the history at once.</p>
<p><span id="index-recursive_002dfiles_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>recursive-files</code></p>
<p>If this style is set, its value is an array of patterns to be tested
against ‘<code>$PWD/</code>’: note the trailing slash, which allows directories in
the pattern to be delimited unambiguously by including slashes on both
sides. If an ordinary file completion fails and the word on the command
line does not yet have a directory part to its name, the style is
retrieved using the same tag as for the completion just attempted, then
the elements tested against <code>$PWD/</code> in turn. If one matches, then the
shell reattempts completion by prepending the word on the command line
with each directory in the expansion of <code>**/*(/)</code> in turn. Typically the
elements of the style will be set to restrict the number of directories
beneath the current one to a manageable number, for example
‘<code>*/.git/*</code>’.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' recursive-files '*/zsh/*'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If the current directory is <code>/home/pws/zsh/Src</code>, then <code>zle_tr</code><em>TAB</em> can
be completed to <code>Zle/zle_tricky.c</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-regular_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>regular</code></p>
<p>This style is used by the <code>_expand_alias</code> completer and bindable
command. If set to ‘true’ (the default), regular aliases will be
expanded but only in command position. If it is set to ‘false’, regular
aliases will never be expanded. If it is set to ‘<code>always</code>’, regular
aliases will be expanded even if not in command position.</p>
<p><span id="index-rehash_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>rehash</code></p>
<p>If this is set when completing external commands, the internal list
(hash) of commands will be updated for each search by issuing the
<code>rehash</code> command. There is a speed penalty for this which is only likely
to be noticeable when directories in the path have slow file access.</p>
<p><span id="index-remote_002daccess_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>remote-access</code></p>
<p>If set to ‘false’, certain commands will be prevented from making
Internet connections to retrieve remote information. This includes the
completion for the <code>CVS</code> command.</p>
<p>It is not always possible to know if connections are in fact to a remote
site, so some may be prevented unnecessarily.</p>
<p><span id="index-remove_002dall_002ddups_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>remove-all-dups</code></p>
<p>The <code>_history_complete_word</code> bindable command and the <code>_history</code>
completer use this to decide if all duplicate matches should be removed,
rather than just consecutive duplicates.</p>
<p><span id="index-select_002dprompt_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>select-prompt</code></p>
<p>If this is set for the <code>default</code> tag, its value will be displayed during
menu selection (see the <code>menu</code> style above) when the completion list
does not fit on the screen as a whole. The same escapes as for the
<code>list-prompt</code> style are understood, except that the numbers refer to the
match or line the mark is on. A default prompt is used when the value is
the empty string.</p>
<p><span id="index-select_002dscroll_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>select-scroll</code></p>
<p>This style is tested for the <code>default</code> tag and determines how a
completion list is scrolled during a menu selection (see the <code>menu</code>
style above) when the completion list does not fit on the screen as a
whole. If the value is ‘<code>0</code>’ (zero), the list is scrolled by
half-screenfuls; if it is a positive integer, the list is scrolled by
the given number of lines; if it is a negative number, the list is
scrolled by a screenful minus the absolute value of the given number of
lines. The default is to scroll by single lines.</p>
<p><span id="index-separate_002dsections_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>separate-sections</code></p>
<p>This style is used with the <code>manuals</code> tag when completing names of
manual pages. If it is ‘true’, entries for different sections are added
separately using tag names of the form ‘<code>manual.``X</code>’, where <code>X</code> is the
section number. When the <code>group-name</code> style is also in effect, pages
from different sections will appear separately. This style is also used
similarly with the <code>words</code> style when completing words for the dict
command. It allows words from different dictionary databases to be added
separately. The default for this style is ‘false’.</p>
<p><span id="index-show_002dambiguity_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>show-ambiguity</code></p>
<p>If the <code>zsh/complist</code> module is loaded, this style can be used to
highlight the first ambiguous character in completion lists. The value
is either a color indication such as those supported by the
<code>list-colors</code> style or, with a value of ‘true’, a default of underlining
is selected. The highlighting is only applied if the completion display
strings correspond to the actual matches.</p>
<p><span id="index-show_002dcompleter_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>show-completer</code></p>
<p>Tested whenever a new completer is tried. If it is ‘true’, the
completion system outputs a progress message in the listing area showing
what completer is being tried. The message will be overwritten by any
output when completions are found and is removed after completion is
finished.</p>
<p><span id="index-single_002dignored_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>single-ignored</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_ignored</code> completer when there is only one match.
If its value is ‘<code>show</code>’, the single match will be displayed but not
inserted. If the value is ‘<code>menu</code>’, then the single match and the
original string are both added as matches and menu completion is
started, making it easy to select either of them.</p>
<p><span id="index-sort_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>sort</code></p>
<p>This allows the standard ordering of matches to be overridden.</p>
<p>If its value is ‘<code>true</code>’ or ‘<code>false</code>’, sorting is enabled or disabled.
Additionally the values associated with the ‘<code>-o</code>’ option to <code>compadd</code>
can also be listed: <code>match</code>, <code>nosort</code>, <code>numeric</code>, <code>reverse</code>. If it is
not set for the context, the standard behaviour of the calling widget is
used.</p>
<p>The style is tested first against the full context including the tag,
and if that fails to produce a value against the context without the
tag.</p>
<p>In many cases where a calling widget explicitly selects a particular
ordering in lieu of the default, a value of ‘<code>true</code>’ is not honoured. An
example of where this is not the case is for command history where the
default of sorting matches chronologically may be overridden by setting
the style to ‘true’.</p>
<p>In the <code>_expand</code> completer, if it is set to ‘true’, the expansions
generated will always be sorted. If it is set to ‘<code>menu</code>’, then the
expansions are only sorted when they are offered as single strings but
not in the string containing all possible expansions.</p>
<p><span id="index-special_002ddirs_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>special-dirs</code></p>
<p>Normally, the completion code will not produce the directory names ‘<code>.</code>’
and ‘<code>..</code>’ as possible completions. If this style is set to ‘true’, it
will add both ‘<code>.</code>’ and ‘<code>..</code>’ as possible completions; if it is set to
‘<code>..</code>’, only ‘<code>..</code>’ will be added.</p>
<p>The following example sets <code>special-dirs</code> to ‘<code>..</code>’ when the current
prefix is empty, is a single ‘<code>.</code>’, or consists only of a path beginning
with ‘<code>../</code>’. Otherwise the value is ‘false’.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle -e ':completion:*' special-dirs \ 
   '[[ $PREFIX = (../)#(|.|..) ]] &amp;&amp; reply=(..)'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-squeeze_002dslashes_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>squeeze-slashes</code></p>
<p>If set to ‘true’, sequences of slashes in filename paths (for example in
‘<code>foo//bar</code>’) will be treated as a single slash. This is the usual
behaviour of UNIX paths. However, by default the file completion
function behaves as if there were a ‘<code>*</code>’ between the slashes.</p>
<p><span id="index-stop_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>stop</code></p>
<p>If set to ‘true’, the <code>_history_complete_word</code> bindable command will
stop once when reaching the beginning or end of the history. Invoking
<code>_history_complete_word</code> will then wrap around to the opposite end of
the history. If this style is set to ‘false’ (the default),
<code>_history_complete_word</code> will loop immediately as in a menu completion.</p>
<p><span id="index-strip_002dcomments_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>strip-comments</code></p>
<p>If set to ‘true’, this style causes non-essential comment text to be
removed from completion matches. Currently it is only used when
completing e-mail addresses where it removes any display name from the
addresses, cutting them down to plain <code>user@host</code> form.</p>
<p><span id="index-subst_002dglobs_002donly_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>subst-globs-only</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_expand</code> completer. If it is set to ‘true’, the
expansion will only be used if it resulted from globbing; hence, if
expansions resulted from the use of the <code>substitute</code> style described
below, but these were not further changed by globbing, the expansions
will be rejected.</p>
<p>The default for this style is ‘false’.</p>
<p><span id="index-substitute_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>substitute</code></p>
<p>This boolean style controls whether the <code>_expand</code> completer will first
try to expand all substitutions in the string (such as ‘<code>$(``...``)</code>’
and ‘<code>${``...``}</code>’).</p>
<p>The default is ‘true’.</p>
<p><span id="index-suffix_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>suffix</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_expand</code> completer if the word starts with a tilde
or contains a parameter expansion. If it is set to ‘true’, the word will
only be expanded if it doesn’t have a suffix, i.e. if it is something
like ‘<code>~foo</code>’ or ‘<code>$foo</code>’ rather than ‘<code>~foo/</code>’ or ‘<code>$foo/bar</code>’, unless
that suffix itself contains characters eligible for expansion. The
default for this style is ‘true’.</p>
<p><span id="index-tag_002dorder_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>tag-order</code></p>
<p>This provides a mechanism for sorting how the tags available in a
particular context will be used.</p>
<p>The values for the style are sets of space-separated lists of tags. The
tags in each value will be tried at the same time; if no match is found,
the next value is used. (See the <code>file-patterns</code> style for an exception
to this behavior.)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:complete:-command-:*:*' tag-order \ 
    'commands functions'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>specifies that completion in command position first offers external
commands and shell functions. Remaining tags will be tried if no
completions are found.</p>
<p>In addition to tag names, each string in the value may take one of the
following forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-</code><br />
If any value consists of only a hyphen, then <em>only</em> the tags
specified in the other values are generated. Normally all tags not
explicitly selected are tried last if the specified tags fail to
generate any matches. This means that a single value consisting only
of a single hyphen turns off completion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>!</code> <code>tags</code>...<br />
A string starting with an exclamation mark specifies names of tags
that are <em>not</em> to be used. The effect is the same as if all other
possible tags for the context had been listed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tag``:``label</code> ...<br />
Here, <code>tag</code> is one of the standard tags and <code>label</code> is an arbitrary
name. Matches are generated as normal but the name <code>label</code> is used
in contexts instead of <code>tag</code>. This is not useful in words starting
with <code>!</code>.</p>
<p>If the <code>label</code> starts with a hyphen, the <code>tag</code> is prepended to the
<code>label</code> to form the name used for lookup. This can be used to make
the completion system try a certain tag more than once, supplying
different style settings for each attempt; see below for an example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tag``:``label``:``description</code><br />
As before, but <code>description</code> will replace the ‘<code>%d</code>’ in the value of
the <code>format</code> style instead of the default description supplied by
the completion function. Spaces in the description must be quoted
with a backslash. A ‘<code>%d</code>’ appearing in <code>description</code> is replaced
with the description given by the completion function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any of the forms above the tag may be a pattern or several patterns
in the form ‘<code>{``pat1``,``pat2...``}</code>’. In this case all matching tags
will be used except for any given explicitly in the same string.</p>
<p>One use of these features is to try one tag more than once, setting
other styles differently on each attempt, but still to use all the other
tags without having to repeat them all. For example, to make completion
of function names in command position ignore all the completion
functions starting with an underscore the first time completion is
tried:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:*:-command-:*:*' tag-order \ 
    'functions:-non-comp *' functions
zstyle ':completion:*:functions-non-comp' \ 
    ignored-patterns '_*'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>On the first attempt, all tags will be offered but the <code>functions</code> tag
will be replaced by <code>functions-non-comp</code>. The <code>ignored-patterns</code> style
is set for this tag to exclude functions starting with an underscore. If
there are no matches, the second value of the <code>tag-order</code> style is used
which completes functions using the default tag, this time presumably
including all function names.</p>
<p>The matches for one tag can be split into different groups. For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' tag-order \ 
    'options:-long:long\ options
     options:-short:short\ options
     options:-single-letter:single\ letter\ options'
zstyle ':completion:*:options-long' \ 
     ignored-patterns '[-+](|-|[^-]*)'
zstyle ':completion:*:options-short' \ 
     ignored-patterns '--*' '[-+]?'
zstyle ':completion:*:options-single-letter' \ 
     ignored-patterns '???*'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>With the <code>group-names</code> style set, options beginning with ‘<code>-``-</code>’,
options beginning with a single ‘<code>-</code>’ or ‘<code>+</code>’ but containing multiple
characters, and single-letter options will be displayed in separate
groups with different descriptions.</p>
<p>Another use of patterns is to try multiple match specifications one
after another. The <code>matcher-list</code> style offers something similar, but it
is tested very early in the completion system and hence can’t be set for
single commands nor for more specific contexts. Here is how to try
normal completion without any match specification and, if that generates
no matches, try again with case-insensitive matching, restricting the
effect to arguments of the command <code>foo</code>:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*:*:foo:*:*' tag-order '*' '*:-case'
zstyle ':completion:*-case' matcher 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>First, all the tags offered when completing after <code>foo</code> are tried using
the normal tag name. If that generates no matches, the second value of
<code>tag-order</code> is used, which tries all tags again except that this time
each has <code>-case</code> appended to its name for lookup of styles. Hence this
time the value for the <code>matcher</code> style from the second call to <code>zstyle</code>
in the example is used to make completion case-insensitive.</p>
<p>It is possible to use the <code>-e</code> option of the <code>zstyle</code> builtin command to
specify conditions for the use of particular tags. For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle -e '*:-command-:*' tag-order '
    if [[ -n $PREFIX$SUFFIX ]]; then
      reply=( )
    else
      reply=( - )
    fi'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Completion in command position will be attempted only if the string
typed so far is not empty. This is tested using the <code>PREFIX</code> special
parameter; see <a href="Completion-Widgets.html#Completion-Widgets">Completion
Widgets</a> for a description
of parameters which are special inside completion widgets. Setting
<code>reply</code> to an empty array provides the default behaviour of trying all
tags at once; setting it to an array containing only a hyphen disables
the use of all tags and hence of all completions.</p>
<p>If no <code>tag-order</code> style has been defined for a context, the strings
‘<code>(|*-)argument-* (|*-)option-* values</code>’ and ‘<code>options</code>’ plus all tags
offered by the completion function will be used to provide a sensible
default behavior that causes arguments (whether normal command arguments
or arguments of options) to be completed before option names for most
commands.</p>
<p><span id="index-urls_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>urls</code></p>
<p>This is used together with the <code>urls</code> tag by functions completing URLs.</p>
<p>If the value consists of more than one string, or if the only string
does not name a file or directory, the strings are used as the URLs to
complete.</p>
<p>If the value contains only one string which is the name of a normal file
the URLs are taken from that file (where the URLs may be separated by
white space or newlines).</p>
<p>Finally, if the only string in the value names a directory, the
directory hierarchy rooted at this directory gives the completions. The
top level directory should be the file access method, such as ‘<code>http</code>’,
‘<code>ftp</code>’, ‘<code>bookmark</code>’ and so on. In many cases the next level of
directories will be a filename. The directory hierarchy can descend as
deep as necessary.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' urls ~/.urls
mkdir -p ~/.urls/ftp/ftp.zsh.org/pub
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>allows completion of all the components of the URL ‘<code>netscape</code>’ or
‘<code>lynx</code>’. Note, however, that access methods and files are completed
separately, so if the <code>hosts</code> style is set hosts can be completed
without reference to the <code>urls</code> style.</p>
<p>See the description in the function <code>_urls</code> itself for more information
(e.g. ‘<code>more $^fpath/_urls(N)</code>’).</p>
<p><span id="index-use_002dcache_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>use-cache</code></p>
<p>If this is set, the completion caching layer is activated for any
completions which use it (via the <code>_store_cache</code>, <code>_retrieve_cache</code>, and
<code>_cache_invalid</code> functions). The directory containing the cache files
can be changed with the <code>cache-path</code> style.</p>
<p><span id="index-use_002dcompctl_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>use-compctl</code></p>
<p>If this style is set to a string <em>not</em> equal to <code>false</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>no</code>, and
<code>off</code>, the completion system may use any completion specifications
defined with the <code>compctl</code> builtin command. If the style is unset, this
is done only if the <code>zsh/compctl</code> module is loaded. The string may also
contain the substring ‘<code>first</code>’ to use completions defined with
‘<code>compctl -T</code>’, and the substring ‘<code>default</code>’ to use the completion
defined with ‘<code>compctl -D</code>’.</p>
<p>Note that this is only intended to smooth the transition from <code>compctl</code>
to the new completion system and may disappear in the future.</p>
<p>Note also that the definitions from <code>compctl</code> will only be used if there
is no specific completion function for the command in question. For
example, if there is a function <code>_foo</code> to complete arguments to the
command <code>foo</code>, <code>compctl</code> will never be invoked for <code>foo</code>. However, the
<code>compctl</code> version will be tried if <code>foo</code> only uses default completion.</p>
<p><span id="index-use_002dip_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>use-ip</code></p>
<p>By default, the function <code>_hosts</code> that completes host names strips IP
addresses from entries read from host databases such as NIS and ssh
files. If this style is ‘true’, the corresponding IP addresses can be
completed as well. This style is not use in any context where the
<code>hosts</code> style is set; note also it must be set before the cache of host
names is generated (typically the first completion attempt).</p>
<p><span id="index-users_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>users</code></p>
<p>This may be set to a list of usernames to be completed. If it is not set
all usernames will be completed. Note that if it is set only that list
of users will be completed; this is because on some systems querying all
users can take a prohibitive amount of time.</p>
<p><span id="index-users_002dhosts_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>users-hosts</code></p>
<p>The values of this style should be of the form ‘<code>user``@``host</code>’ or
‘<code>user``:``host</code>’. It is used for commands that need pairs of user-
and hostnames. These commands will complete usernames from this style
(only), and will restrict subsequent hostname completion to hosts paired
with that user in one of the values of the style.</p>
<p>It is possible to group values for sets of commands which allow a remote
login, such as <code>rlogin</code> and <code>ssh</code>, by using the <code>my-accounts</code> tag.
Similarly, values for sets of commands which usually refer to the
accounts of other people, such as <code>talk</code> and <code>finger</code>, can be grouped by
using the <code>other-accounts</code> tag. More ambivalent commands may use the
<code>accounts</code> tag.</p>
<p><span id="index-users_002dhosts_002dports_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>users-hosts-ports</code></p>
<p>Like <code>users-hosts</code> but used for commands like <code>telnet</code> and containing
strings of the form ‘<code>user``@``host``:``port</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-verbose_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>verbose</code></p>
<p>If set, as it is by default, the completion listing is more verbose. In
particular many commands show descriptions for options if this style is
‘true’.</p>
<p><span id="index-word_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p><code>word</code></p>
<p>This is used by the <code>_list</code> completer, which prevents the insertion of
completions until a second completion attempt when the line has not
changed. The normal way of finding out if the line has changed is to
compare its entire contents between the two occasions. If this style is
‘true’, the comparison is instead performed only on the current word.
Hence if completion is performed on another word with the same contents,
completion will not be delayed.</p>

<p><span id="Control-Functions"></span>
<span id="Control-Functions-1"></span></p>
<h2 id="204-control-functions"><a class="header" href="#204-control-functions">20.4 Control Functions</a></h2>
<p><span id="index-completion-system_002c-choosing-completers"></span></p>
<p>The initialization script <code>compinit</code> redefines all the widgets which
perform completion to call the supplied widget function
<code>_main_complete</code>. This function acts as a wrapper calling the so-called
‘completer’ functions that generate matches. If <code>_main_complete</code> is
called with arguments, these are taken as the names of completer
functions to be called in the order given. If no arguments are given,
the set of functions to try is taken from the <code>completer</code> style. For
example, to use normal completion and correction if that doesn’t
generate any matches:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _correct
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>after calling <code>compinit</code>. The default value for this style is
‘<code>_complete _ignored</code>’, i.e. normally only ordinary completion is
tried, first with the effect of the <code>ignored-patterns</code> style and then
without it. The <code>_main_complete</code> function uses the return status of the
completer functions to decide if other completers should be called. If
the return status is zero, no other completers are tried and the
<code>_main_complete</code> function returns.</p>
<p>If the first argument to <code>_main_complete</code> is a single hyphen, the
arguments will not be taken as names of completers. Instead, the second
argument gives a name to use in the <code>completer</code> field of the context and
the other arguments give a command name and arguments to call to
generate the matches.</p>
<p>The following completer functions are contained in the distribution,
although users may write their own. Note that in contexts the leading
underscore is stripped, for example basic completion is performed in the
context ‘<code>:completion::complete:``...</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-completion-system_002c-completers"></span></p>
<p><span id="index-_005fall_005fmatches"></span></p>
<p><code>_all_matches</code></p>
<p>This completer can be used to add a string consisting of all other
matches. As it influences later completers it must appear as the first
completer in the list. The list of all matches is affected by the
<code>avoid-completer</code> and <code>old-matches</code> styles described above.</p>
<p>It may be useful to use the <code>_generic</code> function described below to bind
<code>_all_matches</code> to its own keystroke, for example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zle -C all-matches complete-word _generic
bindkey '^Xa' all-matches
zstyle ':completion:all-matches:*' old-matches only
zstyle ':completion:all-matches::::' completer _all_matches
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note that this does not generate completions by itself: first use any of
the standard ways of generating a list of completions, then use <code>^Xa</code> to
show all matches. It is possible instead to add a standard completer to
the list and request that the list of all matches should be directly
inserted:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:all-matches::::' completer \ 
       _all_matches _complete
zstyle ':completion:all-matches:*' insert true
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In this case the <code>old-matches</code> style should not be set.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fapproximate"></span></p>
<p><code>_approximate</code></p>
<p>This is similar to the basic <code>_complete</code> completer but allows the
completions to undergo corrections. The maximum number of errors can be
specified by the <code>max-errors</code> style; see the description of approximate
matching in <a href="Expansion.html#Filename-Generation">Filename Generation</a>
for how errors are counted. Normally this completer will only be tried
after the normal <code>_complete</code> completer:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _approximate
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This will give correcting completion if and only if normal completion
yields no possible completions. When corrected completions are found,
the completer will normally start menu completion allowing you to cycle
through these strings.</p>
<p>This completer uses the tags <code>corrections</code> and <code>original</code> when
generating the possible corrections and the original string. The
<code>format</code> style for the former may contain the additional sequences
‘<code>%e</code>’ and ‘<code>%o</code>’ which will be replaced by the number of errors
accepted to generate the corrections and the original string,
respectively.</p>
<p>The completer progressively increases the number of errors allowed up to
the limit by the <code>max-errors</code> style, hence if a completion is found with
one error, no completions with two errors will be shown, and so on. It
modifies the completer name in the context to indicate the number of
errors being tried: on the first try the completer field contains
‘<code>approximate-1</code>’, on the second try ‘<code>approximate-2</code>’, and so on.</p>
<p>When <code>_approximate</code> is called from another function, the number of
errors to accept may be passed with the <code>-a</code> option. The argument is in
the same format as the <code>max-errors</code> style, all in one string.</p>
<p>Note that this completer (and the <code>_correct</code> completer mentioned below)
can be quite expensive to call, especially when a large number of errors
are allowed. One way to avoid this is to set up the <code>completer</code> style
using the <code>-e</code> option to zstyle so that some completers are only used
when completion is attempted a second time on the same string, e.g.:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle -e ':completion:*' completer '
  if [[ $_last_try != &quot;$HISTNO$BUFFER$CURSOR&quot; ]]; then
    _last_try=&quot;$HISTNO$BUFFER$CURSOR&quot;
    reply=(_complete _match _prefix)
  else
    reply=(_ignored _correct _approximate)
  fi'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This uses the <code>HISTNO</code> parameter and the <code>BUFFER</code> and <code>CURSOR</code> special
parameters that are available inside zle and completion widgets to find
out if the command line hasn’t changed since the last time completion
was tried. Only then are the <code>_ignored</code>, <code>_correct</code> and <code>_approximate</code>
completers called.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcanonical_005fpaths"></span></p>
<p><code>_canonical_paths</code> [ <code>-A</code> <code>var</code> ] [ <code>-N</code> ] [ <code>-MJV12nfX</code> ] <code>tag</code>
<code>descr</code> [ <code>paths</code> ... ]</p>
<p>This completion function completes all paths given to it, and also tries
to offer completions which point to the same file as one of the paths
given (relative path when an absolute path is given, and vice versa;
when <code>..</code>’s are present in the word to be completed; and some paths got
from symlinks).</p>
<p><code>-A</code>, if specified, takes the paths from the array variable specified.
Paths can also be specified on the command line as shown above. <code>-N</code>, if
specified, prevents canonicalizing the paths given before using them for
completion, in case they are already so. The options <code>-M</code>, <code>-J</code>, <code>-V</code>,
<code>-1</code>, <code>-2</code>, <code>-n</code>, <code>-F</code>, <code>-X</code> are passed to <code>compadd</code>.</p>
<p>See <code>_description</code> for a description of <code>tag</code> and <code>descr</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcmdambivalent"></span></p>
<p><code>_cmdambivalent</code></p>
<p>Completes the remaining positional arguments as an external command. The
external command and its arguments are completed as separate arguments
(in a manner appropriate for completing <code>/usr/bin/env</code>) if there are two
or more remaining positional arguments on the command line, and as a
quoted command string (in the manner of <code>system(...)</code>) otherwise. See
also <code>_cmdstring</code> and <code>_precommand</code>.</p>
<p>This function takes no arguments.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcmdstring"></span></p>
<p><code>_cmdstring</code></p>
<p>Completes an external command as a single argument, as for
<code>system(...)</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcomplete"></span></p>
<p><code>_complete</code></p>
<p>This completer generates all possible completions in a context-sensitive
manner, i.e. using the settings defined with the <code>compdef</code> function
explained above and the current settings of all special parameters. This
gives the normal completion behaviour.</p>
<p>To complete arguments of commands, <code>_complete</code> uses the utility function
<code>_normal</code>, which is in turn responsible for finding the particular
function; it is described below. Various contexts of the form
<code>-``context``-</code> are handled specifically. These are all mentioned above
as possible arguments to the <code>#compdef</code> tag.</p>
<p>Before trying to find a function for a specific context, <code>_complete</code>
checks if the parameter ‘<code>compcontext</code>’ is set. Setting ‘<code>compcontext</code>’
allows the usual completion dispatching to be overridden which is useful
in places such as a function that uses <code>vared</code> for input. If it is set
to an array, the elements are taken to be the possible matches which
will be completed using the tag ‘<code>values</code>’ and the description
‘<code>value</code>’. If it is set to an associative array, the keys are used
as the possible completions and the values (if non-empty) are used as
descriptions for the matches. If ‘<code>compcontext</code>’ is set to a string
containing colons, it should be of the form
‘<code>tag``:``descr``:``action</code>’. In this case the <code>tag</code> and <code>descr</code>
give the tag and description to use and the <code>action</code> indicates what
should be completed in one of the forms accepted by the <code>_arguments</code>
utility function described below.</p>
<p>Finally, if ‘<code>compcontext</code>’ is set to a string without colons, the value
is taken as the name of the context to use and the function defined for
that context will be called. For this purpose, there is a special
context named <code>-command-line-</code> that completes whole command lines
(commands and their arguments). This is not used by the completion
system itself but is nonetheless handled when explicitly called.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcorrect"></span></p>
<p><code>_correct</code></p>
<p>Generate corrections, but not completions, for the current word; this is
similar to <code>_approximate</code> but will not allow any number of extra
characters at the cursor as that completer does. The effect is similar
to spell-checking. It is based on <code>_approximate</code>, but the completer
field in the context name is <code>correct</code>.</p>
<p>For example, with:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:::::' completer \ 
       _complete _correct _approximate
zstyle ':completion:*:correct:::' max-errors 2 not-numeric
zstyle ':completion:*:approximate:::' max-errors 3 numeric
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>correction will accept up to two errors. If a numeric argument is given,
correction will not be performed, but correcting completion will be, and
will accept as many errors as given by the numeric argument. Without a
numeric argument, first correction and then correcting completion will
be tried, with the first one accepting two errors and the second one
accepting three errors.</p>
<p>When <code>_correct</code> is called as a function, the number of errors to accept
may be given following the <code>-a</code> option. The argument is in the same form
a values to the <code>accept</code> style, all in one string.</p>
<p>This completer function is intended to be used without the
<code>_approximate</code> completer or, as in the example, just before it. Using it
after the <code>_approximate</code> completer is useless since <code>_approximate</code> will
at least generate the corrected strings generated by the <code>_correct</code>
completer — and probably more.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fexpand"></span></p>
<p><code>_expand</code></p>
<p>This completer function does not really perform completion, but instead
checks if the word on the command line is eligible for expansion and, if
it is, gives detailed control over how this expansion is done. For this
to happen, the completion system needs to be invoked with
<code>complete-word</code>, not <code>expand-or-complete</code> (the default binding for
<code>TAB</code>), as otherwise the string will be expanded by the shell’s internal
mechanism before the completion system is started. Note also this
completer should be called before the <code>_complete</code> completer function.</p>
<p>The tags used when generating expansions are <code>all-expansions</code> for the
string containing all possible expansions, <code>expansions</code> when adding the
possible expansions as single matches and <code>original</code> when adding the
original string from the line. The order in which these strings are
generated, if at all, can be controlled by the <code>group-order</code> and
<code>tag-order</code> styles, as usual.</p>
<p>The format string for <code>all-expansions</code> and for <code>expansions</code> may contain
the sequence ‘<code>%o</code>’ which will be replaced by the original string from
the line.</p>
<p>The kind of expansion to be tried is controlled by the <code>substitute</code>,
<code>glob</code> and <code>subst-globs-only</code> styles.</p>
<p>It is also possible to call <code>_expand</code> as a function, in which case the
different modes may be selected with options: <code>-s</code> for <code>substitute</code>,
<code>-g</code> for <code>glob</code> and <code>-o</code> for <code>subst-globs-only</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fexpand_005falias"></span></p>
<p><code>_expand_alias</code></p>
<p>If the word the cursor is on is an alias, it is expanded and no other
completers are called. The types of aliases which are to be expanded can
be controlled with the styles <code>regular</code>, <code>global</code> and <code>disabled</code>.</p>
<p>This function is also a bindable command, see <a href="#Bindable-Commands">Bindable
Commands</a>.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fextensions"></span></p>
<p><code>_extensions</code></p>
<p>If the cursor follows the string ‘<code>*.</code>’, filename extensions are
completed. The extensions are taken from files in current directory or a
directory specified at the beginning of the current word. For exact
matches, completion continues to allow other completers such as
<code>_expand</code> to expand the pattern. The standard <code>add-space</code> and
<code>prefix-hidden</code> styles are observed.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fexternal_005fpwds"></span></p>
<p><code>_external_pwds</code></p>
<p>Completes current directories of other zsh processes belonging to the
current user.</p>
<p>This is intended to be used via <code>_generic</code>, bound to a custom key
combination. Note that pattern matching is enabled so matching is
performed similar to how it works with the <code>_match</code> completer.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fhistory"></span></p>
<p><code>_history</code></p>
<p>Complete words from the shell’s command history. This completer can be
controlled by the <code>remove-all-dups</code>, and <code>sort</code> styles as for the
<code>_history_complete_word</code> bindable command, see <a href="#Bindable-Commands">Bindable
Commands</a> and <a href="#Completion-System-Configuration">Completion System
Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fignored"></span></p>
<p><code>_ignored</code></p>
<p>The <code>ignored-patterns</code> style can be set to a list of patterns which are
compared against possible completions; matching ones are removed. With
this completer those matches can be reinstated, as if no
<code>ignored-patterns</code> style were set. The completer actually generates its
own list of matches; which completers are invoked is determined in the
same way as for the <code>_prefix</code> completer. The <code>single-ignored</code> style is
also available as described above.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005flist"></span></p>
<p><code>_list</code></p>
<p>This completer allows the insertion of matches to be delayed until
completion is attempted a second time without the word on the line being
changed. On the first attempt, only the list of matches will be shown.
It is affected by the styles <code>condition</code> and <code>word</code>, see <a href="#Completion-System-Configuration">Completion
System Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fmatch"></span></p>
<p><code>_match</code></p>
<p>This completer is intended to be used after the <code>_complete</code> completer.
It behaves similarly but the string on the command line may be a pattern
to match against trial completions. This gives the effect of the
<code>GLOB_COMPLETE</code> option.</p>
<p>Normally completion will be performed by taking the pattern from the
line, inserting a ‘<code>*</code>’ at the cursor position and comparing the
resulting pattern with the possible completions generated. This can be
modified with the <code>match-original</code> style described above.</p>
<p>The generated matches will be offered in a menu completion unless the
<code>insert-unambiguous</code> style is set to ‘true’; see the description above
for other options for this style.</p>
<p>Note that matcher specifications defined globally or used by the
completion functions (the styles <code>matcher-list</code> and <code>matcher</code>) will not
be used.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fmenu"></span></p>
<p><code>_menu</code></p>
<p>This completer was written as simple example function to show how menu
effect of disabling menu selection which can be useful with <code>_generic</code>
based widgets. It should be used as the first completer in the list.
Note that this is independent of the setting of the <code>MENU_COMPLETE</code>
option and does not work with the other menu completion widgets such as
<code>reverse-menu-complete</code>, or <code>accept-and-menu-complete</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005foldlist"></span></p>
<p><code>_oldlist</code></p>
<p>This completer controls how the standard completion widgets behave when
there is an existing list of completions which may have been generated
by a special completion (i.e. a separately-bound completion command). It
allows the ordinary completion keys to continue to use the list of
completions thus generated, instead of producing a new list of ordinary
contextual completions. It should appear in the list of completers
before any of the widgets which generate matches. It uses two styles:
<code>old-list</code> and <code>old-menu</code>, see <a href="#Completion-System-Configuration">Completion System
Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fprecommand"></span></p>
<p><code>_precommand</code></p>
<p>Complete an external command in word-separated arguments, as for <code>exec</code>
and <code>/usr/bin/env</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fprefix"></span></p>
<p><code>_prefix</code></p>
<p>This completer can be used to try completion with the suffix (everything
after the cursor) ignored. In other words, the suffix will not be
considered to be part of the word to complete. The effect is similar to
the <code>expand-or-complete-prefix</code> command.</p>
<p>The <code>completer</code> style is used to decide which other completers are to be
called to generate matches. If this style is unset, the list of
completers set for the current context is used — except, of course, the
<code>_prefix</code> completer itself. Furthermore, if this completer appears more
than once in the list of completers only those completers not already
tried by the last invocation of <code>_prefix</code> will be called.</p>
<p>For example, consider this global <code>completer</code> style:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' completer \ 
    _complete _prefix _correct _prefix:foo
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Here, the <code>_prefix</code> completer tries normal completion but ignoring the
suffix. If that doesn’t generate any matches, and neither does the call
to the <code>_correct</code> completer after it, <code>_prefix</code> will be called a second
time and, now only trying correction with the suffix ignored. On the
second invocation the completer part of the context appears as ‘<code>foo</code>’.</p>
<p>To use <code>_prefix</code> as the last resort and try only normal completion when
it is invoked:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete ... _prefix
zstyle ':completion::prefix:*' completer _complete
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>add-space</code> style is also respected. If it is set to ‘true’ then
<code>_prefix</code> will insert a space between the matches generated (if any) and
the suffix.</p>
<p>Note that this completer is only useful if the <code>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</code> option
is set; otherwise, the cursor will be moved to the end of the current
word before the completion code is called and hence there will be no
suffix.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fuser_005fexpand"></span></p>
<p><code>_user_expand</code></p>
<p>This completer behaves similarly to the <code>_expand</code> completer but instead
performs expansions defined by users. The styles <code>add-space</code> and <code>sort</code>
styles specific to the <code>_expand</code> completer are usable with
<code>_user_expand</code> in addition to other styles handled more generally by the
completion system. The tag <code>all-expansions</code> is also available.</p>
<p>The expansion depends on the array style <code>user-expand</code> being defined for
the current context; remember that the context for completers is less
specific than that for contextual completion as the full context has not
yet been determined. Elements of the array may have one of the following
forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>$``hash</code><br />
<code>hash</code> is the name of an associative array. Note this is not a full
parameter expression, merely a <code>$</code>, suitably quoted to prevent
immediate expansion, followed by the name of an associative array.
If the trial expansion word matches a key in <code>hash</code>, the resulting
expansion is the corresponding value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>_func</code><br />
<code>_func</code> is the name of a shell function whose name must begin with
<code>_</code> but is not otherwise special to the completion system. The
function is called with the trial word as an argument. If the word
is to be expanded, the function should set the array <code>reply</code> to a
list of expansions. Optionally, it can set <code>REPLY</code> to a word that
will be used as a description for the set of expansions. The return
status of the function is irrelevant.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><span id="index-completion-system_002c-bindable-commands"></span></p>
<p>In addition to the context-dependent completions provided, which are
expected to work in an intuitively obvious way, there are a few widgets
implementing special behaviour which can be bound separately to keys.
The following is a list of these and their default bindings.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fbash_005fcompletions"></span></p>
<p><code>_bash_completions</code></p>
<p>This function is used by two widgets, <code>_bash_complete-word</code> and
<code>_bash_list-choices</code>. It exists to provide compatibility with completion
bindings in bash. The last character of the binding determines what is
completed: ‘<code>!</code>’, command names; ‘<code>$</code>’, environment variables; ‘<code>@</code>’,
host names; ‘<code>/</code>’, file names; ‘<code>~</code>’ user names. In bash, the binding
preceded by ‘<code>\e</code>’ gives completion, and preceded by ‘<code>^X</code>’ lists
options. As some of these bindings clash with standard zsh bindings,
only ‘<code>\e~</code>’ and ‘<code>^X~</code>’ are bound by default. To add the rest, the
following should be added to <code>.zshrc</code> after <code>compinit</code> has been run:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">for key in '!' '$' '@' '/' '~'; do
  bindkey &quot;\e$key&quot; _bash_complete-word
  bindkey &quot;^X$key&quot; _bash_list-choices
done
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This includes the bindings for ‘<code>~</code>’ in case they were already bound to
something else; the completion code does not override user bindings.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcorrect_005ffilename-_0028_005eXC_0029"></span></p>
<p><code>_correct_filename</code> (<code>^XC</code>)</p>
<p>Correct the filename path at the cursor position. Allows up to six
errors in the name. Can also be called with an argument to correct a
filename path, independently of zle; the correction is printed on
standard output.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcorrect_005fword-_0028_005eXc_0029"></span></p>
<p><code>_correct_word</code> (<code>^Xc</code>)</p>
<p>Performs correction of the current argument using the usual contextual
completions as possible choices. This stores the string ‘<code>correct-word</code>’
in the <code>function</code> field of the context name and then calls the
<code>_correct</code> completer.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fexpand_005falias-_0028_005eXa_0029"></span></p>
<p><code>_expand_alias</code> (<code>^Xa</code>)</p>
<p>This function can be used as a completer and as a bindable command. It
expands the word the cursor is on if it is an alias. The types of alias
expanded can be controlled with the styles <code>regular</code>, <code>global</code> and
<code>disabled</code>.</p>
<p>When used as a bindable command there is one additional feature that can
be selected by setting the <code>complete</code> style to ‘true’. In this case, if
the word is not the name of an alias, <code>_expand_alias</code> tries to complete
the word to a full alias name without expanding it. It leaves the cursor
directly after the completed word so that invoking <code>_expand_alias</code> once
more will expand the now-complete alias name.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fexpand_005fword-_0028_005eXe_0029"></span></p>
<p><code>_expand_word</code> (<code>^Xe</code>)</p>
<p>Performs expansion on the current word: equivalent to the standard
<code>expand-word</code> command, but using the <code>_expand</code> completer. Before calling
it, the <code>function</code> field of the context is set to ‘<code>expand-word</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fgeneric"></span></p>
<p><code>_generic</code></p>
<p>This function is not defined as a widget and not bound by default.
However, it can be used to define a widget and will then store the name
of the widget in the <code>function</code> field of the context and call the
completion system. This allows custom completion widgets with their own
set of style settings to be defined easily. For example, to define a
widget that performs normal completion and starts menu selection:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zle -C foo complete-word _generic
bindkey '...' foo
zstyle ':completion:foo:*' menu yes select=1
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note in particular that the <code>completer</code> style may be set for the context
in order to change the set of functions used to generate possible
matches. If <code>_generic</code> is called with arguments, those are passed
through to <code>_main_complete</code> as the list of completers in place of those
defined by the <code>completer</code> style.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fhistory_005fcomplete_005fword-_0028_005ce_002f_0029"></span></p>
<p><code>_history_complete_word</code> (<code>\e/</code>)</p>
<p>Complete words from the shell’s command history. This uses the <code>list</code>,
<code>remove-all-dups</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>stop</code> styles.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fmost_005frecent_005ffile-_0028_005eXm_0029"></span></p>
<p><code>_most_recent_file</code> (<code>^Xm</code>)</p>
<p>Complete the name of the most recently modified file matching the
pattern on the command line (which may be blank). If given a numeric
argument <code>N</code>, complete the <code>N</code>th most recently modified file. Note the
completion, if any, is always unique.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fnext_005ftags-_0028_005eXn_0029"></span></p>
<p><code>_next_tags</code> (<code>^Xn</code>)</p>
<p>This command alters the set of matches used to that for the next tag, or
set of tags, either as given by the <code>tag-order</code> style or as set by
default; these matches would otherwise not be available. Successive
invocations of the command cycle through all possible sets of tags.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fread_005fcomp-_0028_005eX_005eR_0029"></span></p>
<p><code>_read_comp</code> (<code>^X^R</code>)</p>
<p>Prompt the user for a string, and use that to perform completion on the
current word. There are two possibilities for the string. First, it can
be a set of words beginning ‘<code>_</code>’, for example ‘<code>_files -/</code>’, in which
case the function with any arguments will be called to generate the
completions. Unambiguous parts of the function name will be completed
automatically (normal completion is not available at this point) until a
space is typed.</p>
<p>Second, any other string will be passed as a set of arguments to
<code>compadd</code> and should hence be an expression specifying what should be
completed.</p>
<p>A very restricted set of editing commands is available when reading the
string: ‘<code>DEL</code>’ and ‘<code>^H</code>’ delete the last character; ‘<code>^U</code>’ deletes the
line, and ‘<code>^C</code>’ and ‘<code>^G</code>’ abort the function, while ‘<code>RET</code>’ accepts
the completion. Note the string is used verbatim as a command line, so
arguments must be quoted in accordance with standard shell rules.</p>
<p>Once a string has been read, the next call to <code>_read_comp</code> will use the
existing string instead of reading a new one. To force a new string to
be read, call <code>_read_comp</code> with a numeric argument.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcomplete_005fdebug-_0028_005eX_003f_0029"></span></p>
<p><code>_complete_debug</code> (<code>^X?</code>)</p>
<p>This widget performs ordinary completion, but captures in a temporary
file a trace of the shell commands executed by the completion system.
Each completion attempt gets its own file. A command to view each of
these files is pushed onto the editor buffer stack.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcomplete_005fhelp-_0028_005eXh_0029"></span></p>
<p><code>_complete_help</code> (<code>^Xh</code>)</p>
<p>This widget displays information about the context names, the tags, and
the completion functions used when completing at the current cursor
position. If given a numeric argument other than <code>1</code> (as in ‘<code>ESC-2 ^Xh</code>’), then the styles used and the contexts for which they are used
will be shown, too.</p>
<p>Note that the information about styles may be incomplete; it depends on
the information available from the completion functions called, which in
turn is determined by the user’s own styles and other settings.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcomplete_005fhelp_005fgeneric"></span></p>
<p><code>_complete_help_generic</code></p>
<p>Unlike other commands listed here, this must be created as a normal ZLE
widget rather than a completion widget (i.e. with <code>zle -N</code>). It is used
for generating help with a widget bound to the <code>_generic</code> widget that is
described above.</p>
<p>If this widget is created using the name of the function, as it is by
default, then when executed it will read a key sequence. This is
expected to be bound to a call to a completion function that uses the
<code>_generic</code> widget. That widget will be executed, and information
provided in the same format that the <code>_complete_help</code> widget displays
for contextual completion.</p>
<p>If the widget’s name contains <code>debug</code>, for example if it is created as
‘<code>zle -N _complete_debug_generic _complete_help_generic</code>’, it will
read and execute the keystring for a generic widget as before, but then
generate debugging information as done by <code>_complete_debug</code> for
contextual completion.</p>
<p>If the widget’s name contains <code>noread</code>, it will not read a keystring but
instead arrange that the next use of a generic widget run in the same
shell will have the effect as described above.</p>
<p>The widget works by setting the shell parameter
<code>ZSH_TRACE_GENERIC_WIDGET</code> which is read by <code>_generic</code>. Unsetting the
parameter cancels any pending effect of the <code>noread</code> form.</p>
<p>For example, after executing the following:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">zle -N _complete_debug_generic _complete_help_generic
bindkey '^x:' _complete_debug_generic
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>typing ‘<code>C-x :</code>’ followed by the key sequence for a generic widget will
cause trace output for that widget to be saved to a file.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcomplete_005ftag-_0028_005eXt_0029"></span></p>
<p><code>_complete_tag</code> (<code>^Xt</code>)</p>
<p>This widget completes symbol tags created by the <code>etags</code> or <code>ctags</code>
programmes (note there is no connection with the completion system’s
tags) stored in a file <code>TAGS</code>, in the format used by <code>etags</code>, or <code>tags</code>,
in the format created by <code>ctags</code>. It will look back up the path
hierarchy for the first occurrence of either file; if both exist, the
file <code>TAGS</code> is preferred. You can specify the full path to a <code>TAGS</code> or
<code>tags</code> file by setting the parameter <code>$TAGSFILE</code> or <code>$tagsfile</code>
respectively. The corresponding completion tags used are <code>etags</code> and
<code>vtags</code>, after emacs and vi respectively.</p>

<h2 id="206-utility-functions"><a class="header" href="#206-utility-functions">20.6 Utility Functions</a></h2>
<p><span id="index-completion-system_002c-utility-functions"></span></p>
<p>Descriptions follow for utility functions that may be useful when
writing completion functions. If functions are installed in
subdirectories, most of these reside in the <code>Base</code> subdirectory. Like
the example functions for commands in the distribution, the utility
functions generating matches all follow the convention of returning
status zero if they generated completions and non-zero if no matching
completions could be added.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fabsolute_005fcommand_005fpaths"></span></p>
<p><code>_absolute_command_paths</code></p>
<p>This function completes external commands as absolute paths (unlike
<code>_command_names -e</code> which completes their basenames). It takes no
arguments.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fall_005flabels"></span></p>
<p><code>_all_labels</code> [ <code>-x</code> ] [ <code>-12VJ</code> ] <code>tag</code> <code>name</code> <code>descr</code> [ <code>command</code>
<code>arg</code> ... ]</p>
<p>This is a convenient interface to the <code>_next_label</code> function below,
implementing the loop shown in the <code>_next_label</code> example. The <code>command</code>
and its arguments are called to generate the matches. The options stored
in the parameter <code>name</code> will automatically be inserted into the <code>arg</code>s
passed to the <code>command</code>. Normally, they are put directly after the
<code>command</code>, but if one of the <code>arg</code>s is a single hyphen, they are
inserted directly before that. If the hyphen is the last argument, it
will be removed from the argument list before the <code>command</code> is called.
This allows <code>_all_labels</code> to be used in almost all cases where the
matches can be generated by a single call to the <code>compadd</code> builtin
command or by a call to one of the utility functions.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">local expl
...
if _requested foo; then
  ...
  _all_labels foo expl '...' compadd ... - $matches
fi
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Will complete the strings from the <code>matches</code> parameter, using <code>compadd</code>
with additional options which will take precedence over those generated
by <code>_all_labels</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005falternative"></span></p>
<p><code>_alternative</code> [ <code>-O</code> <code>name</code> ] [ <code>-C</code> <code>name</code> ] <code>spec</code> ...</p>
<p>This function is useful in simple cases where multiple tags are
available. Essentially it implements a loop like the one described for
the <code>_tags</code> function below.</p>
<p>The tags to use and the action to perform if a tag is requested are
described using the <code>spec</code>s which are of the form:
‘<code>tag``:``descr``:``action</code>’. The <code>tag</code>s are offered using <code>_tags</code> and
if the tag is requested, the <code>action</code> is executed with the given
description <code>descr</code>. The <code>action</code>s are those accepted by the
<code>_arguments</code> function (described below), excluding the ‘<code>-&gt;``state</code>’ and
‘<code>=``...</code>’ forms.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>action</code> may be a simple function call:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_alternative \ 
    'users:user:_users' \ 
    'hosts:host:_hosts'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>offers usernames and hostnames as possible matches, generated by the
<code>_users</code> and <code>_hosts</code> functions respectively.</p>
<p>Like <code>_arguments</code>, this function uses <code>_all_labels</code> to execute the
actions, which will loop over all sets of tags. Special handling is only
required if there is an additional valid tag, for example inside a
function called from <code>_alternative</code>.</p>
<p>The option ‘<code>-O</code> <code>name</code>’ is used in the same way as by the <code>_arguments</code>
function. In other words, the elements of the <code>name</code> array will be
passed to <code>compadd</code> when executing an action.</p>
<p>Like <code>_tags</code> this function supports the <code>-C</code> option to give a different
name for the argument context field.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005farguments"></span></p>
<p><code>_arguments </code>[ <code>-nswWCRS</code> ] [ <code>-A</code> <code>pat</code> ] [ <code>-O</code> <code>name</code> ] [
<code>-M</code> <code>matchspec</code> ]</p>
<p><code>           </code>[ <code>:</code> ] <code>spec</code> ...</p>
<p><code>_arguments </code>[ <code>opt</code> ... ] <code>-``-</code> [ <code>-l</code> ] [ <code>-i</code> <code>pats</code> ] [
<code>-s</code> <code>pair</code> ]</p>
<p><code>           </code>[ <code>helpspec</code> ...]</p>
<p>This function can be used to give a complete specification for
completion for a command whose arguments follow standard UNIX option and
argument conventions.</p>
<p><em>Options Overview</em></p>
<p>Options to <code>_arguments</code> itself must be in separate words, i.e. <code>-s -w</code>,
not <code>-sw</code>. The options are followed by <code>spec</code>s that describe options and
arguments of the analyzed command. To avoid ambiguity, all options to
<code>_arguments</code> itself may be separated from the <code>spec</code> forms by a single
colon.</p>
<p>The ‘<code>-``-</code>’ form is used to intuit <code>spec</code> forms from the help output of
the command being analyzed, and is described in detail below. The <code>opts</code>
for the ‘<code>-``-</code>’ form are otherwise the same options as the first form.
Note that ‘<code>-s</code>’ following ‘<code>-``-</code>’ has a distinct meaning from ‘<code>-s</code>’
preceding ‘<code>-``-</code>’, and both may appear.</p>
<p>The option switches <code>-s</code>, <code>-S</code>, <code>-A</code>, <code>-w</code>, and <code>-W</code> affect how
<code>_arguments</code> parses the analyzed command line’s options. These switches
are useful for commands with standard argument parsing.</p>
<p>The options of <code>_arguments</code> have the following meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-n</code><br />
With this option, <code>_arguments</code> sets the parameter <code>NORMARG</code> to the
position of the first normal argument in the <code>$words</code> array, i.e.
the position after the end of the options. If that argument has not
been reached, <code>NORMARG</code> is set to <code>-1</code>. The caller should declare
‘<code>integer NORMARG</code>’ if the <code>-n</code> option is passed; otherwise the
parameter is not used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-s</code><br />
Enable <em>option stacking</em> for single-letter options, whereby multiple
single-letter options may be combined into a single word. For
example, the two options ‘<code>-x</code>’ and ‘<code>-y</code>’ may be combined into a
single word ‘<code>-xy</code>’. By default, every word corresponds to a single
option name (‘<code>-xy</code>’ is a single option named ‘<code>xy</code>’).</p>
<p>Options beginning with a single hyphen or plus sign are eligible for
stacking; words beginning with two hyphens are not.</p>
<p>Note that <code>-s</code> after <code>-``-</code> has a different meaning, which is
documented in the segment entitled ‘Deriving <code>spec</code> forms from the
help output’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-w</code><br />
In combination with <code>-s</code>, allow option stacking even if one or more
of the options take arguments. For example, if <code>-x</code> takes an
argument, with no <code>-s</code>, ‘<code>-xy</code>’ is considered as a single
(unhandled) option; with <code>-s</code>, <code>-xy</code> is an option with the argument
‘<code>y</code>’; with both <code>-s</code> and <code>-w</code>, <code>-xy</code> is the option <code>-x</code> and the
option <code>-y</code> with arguments to <code>-x</code> (and to <code>-y</code>, if it takes
arguments) still to come in subsequent words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-W</code><br />
This option takes <code>-w</code> a stage further: it is possible to complete
single-letter options even after an argument that occurs in the same
word. However, it depends on the action performed whether options
will really be completed at this point. For more control, use a
utility function like <code>_guard</code> as part of the action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-C</code><br />
Modify the <code>curcontext</code> parameter for an action of the form
‘<code>-&gt;``state</code>’. This is discussed in detail below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-R</code><br />
Return status 300 instead of zero when a <code>$state</code> is to be handled,
in the ‘<code>-&gt;``string</code>’ syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-S</code><br />
Do not complete options after a ‘<code>-``-</code>’ appearing on the line, and
ignore the ‘<code>-``-</code>’. For example, with <code>-S</code>, in the line</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">foobar -x -- -y
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>the ‘<code>-x</code>’ is considered an option, the ‘<code>-y</code>’ is considered an
argument, and the ‘<code>-``-</code>’ is considered to be neither.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-A</code> <code>pat</code><br />
Do not complete options after the first non-option argument on the
line. <code>pat</code> is a pattern matching all strings which are not to be
taken as arguments. For example, to make <code>_arguments</code> stop
completing options after the first normal argument, but ignoring all
strings starting with a hyphen even if they are not described by one
of the <code>optspec</code>s, the form is ‘<code>-A &quot;-*&quot;</code>’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-O</code> <code>name</code><br />
Pass the elements of the array <code>name</code> as arguments to functions
called to execute <code>action</code>s. This is discussed in detail below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-M</code> <code>matchspec</code><br />
Use the match specification <code>matchspec</code> for completing option names
and values. The default <code>matchspec</code> allows partial word completion
after ‘<code>_</code>’ and ‘<code>-</code>’, such as completing ‘<code>-f-b</code>’ to ‘<code>-foo-bar</code>’.
The default <code>matchspec</code> is:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">r:|[_-]=* r:|=*
</code></pre>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><code>spec</code>s: overview</em></p>
<p>Each of the following forms is a <code>spec</code> describing individual sets of
options or arguments on the command line being analyzed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>n``:``message``:``action</code><br />
<code>n``::``message``:``action</code><br />
This describes the <code>n</code>’th normal argument. The <code>message</code> will be
printed above the matches generated and the <code>action</code> indicates what
can be completed in this position (see below). If there are two
colons before the <code>message</code> the argument is optional. If the
<code>message</code> contains only white space, nothing will be printed above
the matches unless the action adds an explanation string itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>:``message``:``action</code><br />
<code>::``message``:``action</code><br />
Similar, but describes the <em>next</em> argument, whatever number that
happens to be. If all arguments are specified in this form in the
correct order the numbers are unnecessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>*:``message``:``action</code><br />
<code>*::``message``:``action</code><br />
<code>*:::``message``:``action</code><br />
This describes how arguments (usually non-option arguments, those
not beginning with <code>-</code> or <code>+</code>) are to be completed when neither of
the first two forms was provided. Any number of arguments can be
completed in this fashion.</p>
<p>With two colons before the <code>message</code>, the <code>words</code> special array and
the <code>CURRENT</code> special parameter are modified to refer only to the
normal arguments when the <code>action</code> is executed or evaluated. With
three colons before the <code>message</code> they are modified to refer only to
the normal arguments covered by this description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>optspec</code><br />
<code>optspec``:``...</code><br />
This describes an option. The colon indicates handling for one or
more arguments to the option; if it is not present, the option is
assumed to take no arguments.</p>
<p>The following forms are available for the initial <code>optspec</code>, whether
or not the option has arguments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>*``optspec</code><br />
Here <code>optspec</code> is one of the remaining forms below. This
indicates the following <code>optspec</code> may be repeated. Otherwise if
the corresponding option is already present on the command line
to the left of the cursor it will not be offered again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-``optname</code><br />
<code>+``optname</code><br />
In the simplest form the <code>optspec</code> is just the option name
beginning with a minus or a plus sign, such as ‘<code>-foo</code>’. The
first argument for the option (if any) must follow as a
<em>separate</em> word directly after the option.</p>
<p>Either of ‘<code>-+``optname</code>’ and ‘<code>+-``optname</code>’ can be used to
specify that <code>-``optname</code> and <code>+``optname</code> are both valid.</p>
<p>In all the remaining forms, the leading ‘<code>-</code>’ may be replaced by
or paired with ‘<code>+</code>’ in this way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-``optname``-</code><br />
The first argument of the option must come directly after the
option name <em>in the same word</em>. For example, ‘<code>-foo-:``...</code>’
specifies that the completed option and argument will look like
‘<code>-foo``arg</code>’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-``optname``+</code><br />
The first argument may appear immediately after <code>optname</code> in the
same word, or may appear as a separate word after the option.
For example, ‘<code>-foo+:``...</code>’ specifies that the completed option
and argument will look like either ‘<code>-foo``arg</code>’ or ‘<code>-foo</code>
<code>arg</code>’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-``optname``=</code><br />
The argument may appear as the next word, or in same word as the
option name provided that it is separated from it by an equals
sign, for example ‘<code>-foo=``arg</code>’ or ‘<code>-foo</code> <code>arg</code>’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-``optname``=-</code><br />
The argument to the option must appear after an equals sign in
the same word, and may not be given in the next argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>optspec``[``explanation``]</code><br />
An explanation string may be appended to any of the preceding
forms of <code>optspec</code> by enclosing it in brackets, as in ‘<code>-q[query operation]</code>’.</p>
<p>The <code>verbose</code> style is used to decide whether the explanation
strings are displayed with the option in a completion listing.</p>
<p>If no bracketed explanation string is given but the
<code>auto-description</code> style is set and only one argument is
described for this <code>optspec</code>, the value of the style is
displayed, with any appearance of the sequence ‘<code>%d</code>’ in it
replaced by the <code>message</code> of the first <code>optarg</code> that follows the
<code>optspec</code>; see below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible for options with a literal ‘<code>+</code>’ or ‘<code>=</code>’ to appear,
but that character must be quoted, for example ‘<code>-\+</code>’.</p>
<p>Each <code>optarg</code> following an <code>optspec</code> must take one of the following
forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>:``message``:``action</code><br />
<code>::``message``:``action</code><br />
An argument to the option; <code>message</code> and <code>action</code> are treated as
for ordinary arguments. In the first form, the argument is
mandatory, and in the second form it is optional.</p>
<p>This group may be repeated for options which take multiple
arguments. In other words,
<code>:``message1``:``action1``:``message2``:``action2</code> specifies
that the option takes two arguments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>:*``pattern``:``message``:``action</code><br />
<code>:*``pattern``::``message``:``action</code><br />
<code>:*``pattern``:::``message``:``action</code><br />
This describes multiple arguments. Only the last <code>optarg</code> for an
option taking multiple arguments may be given in this form. If
the <code>pattern</code> is empty (i.e. <code>:*:</code>), all the remaining words on
the line are to be completed as described by the <code>action</code>;
otherwise, all the words up to and including a word matching the
<code>pattern</code> are to be completed using the <code>action</code>.</p>
<p>Multiple colons are treated as for the ‘<code>*:``...</code>’ forms for
ordinary arguments: when the <code>message</code> is preceded by two
colons, the <code>words</code> special array and the <code>CURRENT</code> special
parameter are modified during the execution or evaluation of the
<code>action</code> to refer only to the words after the option. When
preceded by three colons, they are modified to refer only to the
words covered by this description.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any literal colon in an <code>optname</code>, <code>message</code>, or <code>action</code> must be
preceded by a backslash, ‘<code>\:</code>’.</p>
<p>Each of the forms above may be preceded by a list in parentheses of
option names and argument numbers. If the given option is on the command
line, the options and arguments indicated in parentheses will not be
offered. For example, ‘<code>(-two -three 1)-one:``...</code>’ completes the option
‘<code>-one</code>’; if this appears on the command line, the options <code>-two</code> and
<code>-three</code> and the first ordinary argument will not be completed after it.
‘<code>(-foo):``...</code>’ specifies an ordinary argument completion; <code>-foo</code> will
not be completed if that argument is already present.</p>
<p>Other items may appear in the list of excluded options to indicate
various other items that should not be applied when the current
specification is matched: a single star (<code>*</code>) for the rest arguments
(i.e. a specification of the form ‘<code>*:``...</code>’); a colon (<code>:</code>) for all
normal (non-option-) arguments; and a hyphen (<code>-</code>) for all options. For
example, if ‘<code>(*)</code>’ appears before an option and the option appears on
the command line, the list of remaining arguments completed.</p>
<p>To aid in reuse of specifications, it is possible to precede any of the
forms above with ‘<code>!</code>’; then the form will no longer be completed,
although if the option or argument appears on the command line they will
be skipped as normal. The main use for this is when the arguments are
given by an array, and <code>_arguments</code> is called repeatedly for more
specific contexts: on the first call ‘<code>_arguments $global_options</code>’ is
used, and on subsequent calls ‘<code>_arguments !$^global_options</code>’.</p>
<p><em><code>spec</code>s: actions</em></p>
<p>In each of the forms above the <code>action</code> determines how completions
should be generated. Except for the ‘<code>-&gt;``string</code>’ form below, the
<code>action</code> will be executed by calling the <code>_all_labels</code> function to
process all tag labels. No special handling of tags is needed unless a
function call introduces a new one.</p>
<p>The functions called to execute <code>action</code>s will be called with the
elements of the array named by the ‘<code>-O</code> <code>name</code>’ option as arguments.
This can be used, for example, to pass the same set of options for the
<code>compadd</code> builtin to all <code>action</code>s.</p>
<p>The forms for <code>action</code> are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code> </code>(single unquoted space)<br />
This is useful where an argument is required but it is not possible
or desirable to generate matches for it. The <code>message</code> will be
displayed but no completions listed. Note that even in this case the
colon at the end of the <code>message</code> is needed; it may only be omitted
when neither a <code>message</code> nor an <code>action</code> is given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>(``item1</code> <code>item2</code> <code>...``)</code><br />
One of a list of possible matches, for example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">:foo:(foo bar baz)
</code></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>((item1\:desc1 ...))</code><br />
Similar to the above, but with descriptions for each possible match.
Note the backslash before the colon. For example,</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">:foo:((a\:bar b\:baz))
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The matches will be listed together with their descriptions if the
<code>description</code> style is set with the <code>values</code> tag in the context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-&gt;``string</code><br />
<span id="index-context_002c-use-of"></span>
<span id="index-line_002c-use-of"></span>
<span id="index-opt_005fargs_002c-use-of"></span></p>
<p>In this form, <code>_arguments</code> processes the arguments and options and
then returns control to the calling function with parameters set to
indicate the state of processing; the calling function then makes
its own arrangements for generating completions. For example,
functions that implement a state machine can use this type of
action.</p>
<p>Where <code>_arguments</code> encounters <code>action</code> in the ‘<code>-&gt;``string</code>’ format,
it will strip all leading and trailing whitespace from <code>string</code> and
set the array <code>state</code> to the set of all <code>string</code>s for which an
action is to be performed. The elements of the array <code>state_descr</code>
are assigned the corresponding <code>message</code> field from each <code>optarg</code>
containing such an <code>action</code>.</p>
<p>By default and in common with all other well behaved completion
functions, _arguments returns status zero if it was able to add
matches and non-zero otherwise. However, if the <code>-R</code> option is
given, <code>_arguments</code> will instead return a status of 300 to indicate
that <code>$state</code> is to be handled.</p>
<p>In addition to <code>$state</code> and <code>$state_descr</code>, <code>_arguments</code> also sets
the global parameters ‘<code>context</code>’, ‘<code>line</code>’ and ‘<code>opt_args</code>’ as
described below, and does not reset any changes made to the special
parameters such as <code>PREFIX</code> and <code>words</code>. This gives the calling
function the choice of resetting these parameters or propagating
changes in them.</p>
<p>A function calling <code>_arguments</code> with at least one action containing
a ‘<code>-&gt;``string</code>’ must therefore declare appropriate local
parameters:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">local context state state_descr line
typeset -A opt_args
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>to prevent <code>_arguments</code> from altering the global environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>{``eval-string``}</code><br />
<span id="index-expl_002c-use-of"></span></p>
<p>A string in braces is evaluated as shell code to generate matches.
If the <code>eval-string</code> itself does not begin with an opening
parenthesis or brace it is split into separate words before
execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code> =  ``action</code><br />
If the <code>action</code> starts with ‘<code>= </code>’ (an equals sign followed by a
space), <code>_arguments</code> will insert the contents of the <code>argument</code>
field of the current context as the new first element in the <code>words</code>
special array and increment the value of the <code>CURRENT</code> special
parameter. This has the effect of inserting a dummy word onto the
completion command line while not changing the point at which
completion is taking place.</p>
<p>This is most useful with one of the specifiers that restrict the
words on the command line on which the <code>action</code> is to operate (the
two- and three-colon forms above). One particular use is when an
<code>action</code> itself causes <code>_arguments</code> on a restricted range; it is
necessary to use this trick to insert an appropriate command name
into the range for the second call to <code>_arguments</code> to be able to
parse the line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code> word...</code><br />
<code>word...</code><br />
This covers all forms other than those above. If the <code>action</code> starts
with a space, the remaining list of words will be invoked unchanged.</p>
<p>Otherwise it will be invoked with some extra strings placed after
the first word; these are to be passed down as options to the
<code>compadd</code> builtin. They ensure that the state specified by
<code>_arguments</code>, in particular the descriptions of options and
arguments, is correctly passed to the completion command. These
additional arguments are taken from the array parameter ‘<code>expl</code>’;
this will be set up before executing the <code>action</code> and hence may be
referred to inside it, typically in an expansion of the form
‘<code>$expl[@]</code>’ which preserves empty elements of the array.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During the performance of the action the array ‘<code>line</code>’ will be set to
the normal arguments from the command line, i.e. the words from the
command line after the command name excluding all options and their
arguments. Options are stored in the associative array ‘<code>opt_args</code>’ with
option names as keys and their arguments as the values. For options that
have more than one argument these are given as one string, separated by
colons. All colons and backslashes in the original arguments are
preceded with backslashes.</p>
<p>The parameter ‘<code>context</code>’ is set when returning to the calling function
to perform an action of the form ‘<code>-&gt;``string</code>’. It is set to an array
of elements corresponding to the elements of <code>$state</code>. Each string of
the form ‘<code>option``-opt``-``n</code>’ for the <code>n</code>’th argument of the option
<code>-opt</code>, or a string of the form ‘<code>argument-``n</code>’ for the <code>n</code>’th
argument. For ‘rest’ arguments, that is those in the list at the end not
handled by position, <code>n</code> is the string ‘<code>rest</code>’. For example, when
completing the argument of the <code>-o</code> option, the name is ‘<code>option-o-1</code>’,
while for the second normal (non-option-) argument it is ‘<code>argument-2</code>’.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the evaluation of the <code>action</code> the context name in
the <code>curcontext</code> parameter is altered to append the same string that is
stored in the <code>context</code> parameter.</p>
<p>The option <code>-C</code> tells <code>_arguments</code> to modify the <code>curcontext</code> parameter
for an action of the form ‘<code>-&gt;``state</code>’. This is the standard parameter
used to keep track of the current context. Here it (and not the
<code>context</code> array) should be made local to the calling function to avoid
passing back the modified value and should be initialised to the current
value at the start of the function:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">local curcontext=&quot;$curcontext&quot;
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This is useful where it is not possible for multiple states to be valid
together.</p>
<p><em>Grouping Options</em></p>
<p>Options can be grouped to simplify exclusion lists. A group is
introduced with ‘<code>+</code>’ followed by a name for the group in the subsequent
word. Whole groups can then be referenced in an exclusion list or a
group name can be used to disambiguate between two forms of the same
option. For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_arguments \ 
    '(group2--x)-a' \ 
  + group1 \ 
    -m \ 
    '(group2)-n' \ 
  + group2 \ 
    -x -y
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If the name of a group is specified in the form ‘<code>(``name``)</code>’ then only
one value from that group will ever be completed; more formally, all
specifications are mutually exclusive to all other specifications in
that group. This is useful for defining options that are aliases for
each other. For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_arguments \ 
    -a -b \ 
  + '(operation)' \ 
    {-c,--compress}'[compress]' \ 
    {-d,--decompress}'[decompress]' \ 
    {-l,--list}'[list]'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If an option in a group appears on the command line, it is stored in the
associative array ‘<code>opt_args</code>’ with ’<code>group``-``option</code>’ as a key. In
the example above, a key ‘<code>operation–c</code>’ is used if the option ‘<code>-c</code>’ is
present on the command line.</p>
<p><em>Specifying Multiple Sets of Arguments</em></p>
<p>It is possible to specify multiple sets of options and arguments with
the sets separated by single hyphens. This differs from groups in that
sets are considered to be mutually exclusive of each other.</p>
<p>Specifications before the first set and from any group are common to all
sets. For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_arguments \ 
    -a \ 
  - set1 \ 
    -c \ 
  - set2 \ 
    -d \ 
    ':arg:(x2 y2)'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This defines two sets. When the command line contains the option ‘<code>-c</code>’,
the ‘<code>-d</code>’ option and the argument will not be considered possible
completions. When it contains ‘<code>-d</code>’ or an argument, the option ‘<code>-c</code>’
will not be considered. However, after ‘<code>-a</code>’ both sets will still be
considered valid.</p>
<p>As for groups, the name of a set may appear in exclusion lists, either
alone or preceding a normal option or argument specification.</p>
<p>The completion code has to parse the command line separately for each
set. This can be slow so sets should only be used when necessary. A
useful alternative is often an option specification with rest-arguments
(as in ‘<code>-foo:*:...</code>’); here the option <code>-foo</code> swallows up all remaining
arguments as described by the <code>optarg</code> definitions.</p>
<p><em>Deriving <code>spec</code> forms from the help output</em></p>
<p>The option ‘<code>-``-</code>’ allows <code>_arguments</code> to work out the names of long
options that support the ‘<code>-``-help</code>’ option which is standard in many
GNU commands. The command word is called with the argument ‘<code>-``-help</code>’
and the output examined for option names. Clearly, it can be dangerous
to pass this to commands which may not support this option as the
behaviour of the command is unspecified.</p>
<p>In addition to options, ‘<code>_arguments -``-</code>’ will try to deduce the types
of arguments available for options when the form ‘<code>-``-``opt``=``val</code>’
is valid. It is also possible to provide hints by examining the help
text of the command and adding <code>helpspec</code> of the form
‘<code>pattern``:``message``:``action</code>’; note that other <code>_arguments</code>
<code>spec</code> forms are not used. The <code>pattern</code> is matched against the help
text for an option, and if it matches the <code>message</code> and <code>action</code> are
used as for other argument specifiers. The special case of ‘<code>*:</code>’ means
both <code>message</code> and <code>action</code> are empty, which has the effect of causing
options having no description in the help output to be ordered in
listings ahead of options that have a description.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_arguments -- '*\*:toggle:(yes no)' \ 
              '*=FILE*:file:_files' \ 
              '*=DIR*:directory:_files -/' \ 
              '*=PATH*:directory:_files -/'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Here, ‘<code>yes</code>’ and ‘<code>no</code>’ will be completed as the argument of options
whose description ends in a star; file names will be completed for
options that contain the substring ‘<code>=FILE</code>’ in the description; and
directories will be completed for options whose description contains
‘<code>=DIR</code>’ or ‘<code>=PATH</code>’. The last three are in fact the default and so
need not be given explicitly, although it is possible to override the
use of these patterns. A typical help text which uses this feature is:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">  -C, --directory=DIR          change to directory DIR
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>so that the above specifications will cause directories to be completed
after ‘<code>-``-directory</code>’, though not after ‘<code>-C</code>’.</p>
<p>Note also that <code>_arguments</code> tries to find out automatically if the
argument for an option is optional. This can be specified explicitly by
doubling the colon before the <code>message</code>.</p>
<p>If the <code>pattern</code> ends in ‘<code>(-)</code>’, this will be removed from the pattern
and the <code>action</code> will be used only directly after the ‘<code>=</code>’, not in the
next word. This is the behaviour of a normal specification defined with
the form ‘<code>=-</code>’.</p>
<p>By default, the command (with the option ‘<code>–help</code>’) is run after
resetting all the locale categories (except for <code>LC_CTYPE</code>) to ‘<code>C</code>’. If
the localized help output is known to work, the option ‘<code>-l</code>’ can be
specified after the ‘<code>_arguments -``-</code>’ so that the command is run in
the current locale.</p>
<p>The ‘<code>_arguments -``-</code>’ can be followed by the option ‘<code>-i</code> <code>patterns</code>’
to give patterns for options which are not to be completed. The patterns
can be given as the name of an array parameter or as a literal list in
parentheses. For example,</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_arguments -- -i \ 
    &quot;(--(en|dis)able-FEATURE*)&quot;
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>will cause completion to ignore the options ‘<code>-``-enable-FEATURE</code>’ and
‘<code>-``-disable-FEATURE</code>’ (this example is useful with GNU <code>configure</code>).</p>
<p>The ‘<code>_arguments -``-</code>’ form can also be followed by the option ‘<code>-s</code>
<code>pair</code>’ to describe option aliases. The <code>pair</code> consists of a list of
alternating patterns and corresponding replacements, enclosed in parens
and quoted so that it forms a single argument word in the <code>_arguments</code>
call.</p>
<p>For example, some <code>configure</code>-script help output describes options only
as ‘<code>-``-enable-foo</code>’, but the script also accepts the negated form
‘<code>-``-disable-foo</code>’. To allow completion of the second form:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_arguments -- -s &quot;((#s)--enable- --disable-)&quot;
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><em>Miscellaneous notes</em></p>
<p>Finally, note that <code>_arguments</code> generally expects to be the primary
function handling any completion for which it is used. It may have side
effects which change the treatment of any matches added by other
functions called after it. To combine <code>_arguments</code> with other functions,
those functions should be called either before <code>_arguments</code>, as an
<code>action</code> within a <code>spec</code>, or in handlers for ‘<code>-&gt;``state</code>’ actions.</p>
<p>Here is a more general example of the use of <code>_arguments</code>:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_arguments '-l+:left border:' \ 
           '-format:paper size:(letter A4)' \ 
           '*-copy:output file:_files::resolution:(300 600)' \ 
           ':postscript file:_files -g \*.\(ps\|eps\)' \ 
           '*:page number:'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This describes three options: ‘<code>-l</code>’, ‘<code>-format</code>’, and ‘<code>-copy</code>’. The
first takes one argument described as ‘<code>left border</code>’ for which no
completion will be offered because of the empty action. Its argument may
come directly after the ‘<code>-l</code>’ or it may be given as the next word on
the line.</p>
<p>The ‘<code>-format</code>’ option takes one argument in the next word, described as
‘<code>paper size</code>’ for which only the strings ‘<code>letter</code>’ and ‘<code>A4</code>’ will be
completed.</p>
<p>The ‘<code>-copy</code>’ option may appear more than once on the command line and
takes two arguments. The first is mandatory and will be completed as a
filename. The second is optional (because of the second colon before the
description ‘<code>resolution</code>’) and will be completed from the strings
‘<code>300</code>’ and ‘<code>600</code>’.</p>
<p>The last two descriptions say what should be completed as arguments. The
first describes the first argument as a ‘<code>postscript file</code>’ and makes
files ending in ‘<code>ps</code>’ or ‘<code>eps</code>’ be completed. The last description
gives all other arguments the description ‘<code>page numbers</code>’ but does not
offer completions.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcache_005finvalid"></span></p>
<p><code>_cache_invalid</code> <code>cache_identifier</code></p>
<p>This function returns status zero if the completions cache corresponding
to the given cache identifier needs rebuilding. It determines this by
looking up the <code>cache-policy</code> style for the current context. This should
provide a function name which is run with the full path to the relevant
cache file as the only argument.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_example_caching_policy () {
    # rebuild if cache is more than a week old
    local -a oldp
    oldp=( &quot;$1&quot;(Nm+7) )
    (( $#oldp ))
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-_005fcall_005ffunction"></span></p>
<p><code>_call_function</code> <code>return</code> <code>name</code> [ <code>arg</code> ... ]</p>
<p>If a function <code>name</code> exists, it is called with the arguments <code>arg</code>s. The
<code>return</code> argument gives the name of a parameter in which the return
status from the function <code>name</code> should be stored; if <code>return</code> is empty
or a single hyphen it is ignored.</p>
<p>The return status of <code>_call_function</code> itself is zero if the function
<code>name</code> exists and was called and non-zero otherwise.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcall_005fprogram"></span></p>
<p><code>_call_program</code> [ <code>-l</code> ] [ <code>-p</code> ] <code>tag</code> <code>string</code> ...</p>
<p>This function provides a mechanism for the user to override the use of
an external command. It looks up the <code>command</code> style with the supplied
<code>tag</code>. If the style is set, its value is used as the command to execute.
The <code>string</code>s from the call to <code>_call_program</code>, or from the style if
set, are concatenated with spaces between them and the resulting string
is evaluated. The return status is the return status of the command
called.</p>
<p>By default, the command is run in an environment where all the locale
categories (except for <code>LC_CTYPE</code>) are reset to ‘<code>C</code>’ by calling the
utility function <code>_comp_locale</code> (see below). If the option ‘<code>-l</code>’ is
given, the command is run with the current locale.</p>
<p>If the option ‘<code>-p</code>’ is supplied it indicates that the command output is
influenced by the permissions it is run with. If the <code>gain-privileges</code>
style is set to true, <code>_call_program</code> will make use of commands such as
<code>sudo</code>, if present on the command-line, to match the permissions to
whatever the final command is likely to run under. When looking up the
<code>gain-privileges</code> and <code>command</code> styles, the command component of the
zstyle context will end with a slash (‘<code>/</code>’) followed by the command
that would be used to gain privileges.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcombination"></span></p>
<p><code>_combination</code> [ <code>-s</code> <code>pattern</code> ] <code>tag</code> <code>style</code> <code>spec</code> ... <code>field</code>
<code>opts</code> ...</p>
<p>This function is used to complete combinations of values, for example
pairs of hostnames and usernames. The <code>style</code> argument gives the style
which defines the pairs; it is looked up in a context with the <code>tag</code>
specified.</p>
<p>The style name consists of field names separated by hyphens, for example
‘<code>users-hosts-ports</code>’. For each field for a value is already known, a
<code>spec</code> of the form ‘<code>field``=``pattern</code>’ is given. For example, if the
command line so far specifies a user ‘<code>pws</code>’, the argument ‘<code>users=pws</code>’
should appear.</p>
<p>The next argument with no equals sign is taken as the name of the field
for which completions should be generated (presumably not one of the
<code>field</code>s for which the value is known).</p>
<p>The matches generated will be taken from the value of the style. These
should contain the possible values for the combinations in the
appropriate order (users, hosts, ports in the example above). The values
for the different fields are separated by colons. This can be altered
with the option <code>-s</code> to <code>_combination</code> which specifies a pattern.
Typically this is a character class, as for example ‘<code>-s &quot;[:@]&quot;</code>’ in the
case of the <code>users-hosts</code> style. Each ‘<code>field``=``pattern</code>’
specification restricts the completions which apply to elements of the
style with appropriately matching fields.</p>
<p>If no style with the given name is defined for the given tag, or if none
of the strings in style’s value match, but a function name of the
required field preceded by an underscore is defined, that function will
be called to generate the matches. For example, if there is no
‘<code>users-hosts-ports</code>’ or no matching hostname when a host is required,
the function ‘<code>_hosts</code>’ will automatically be called.</p>
<p>If the same name is used for more than one field, in both the
‘<code>field``=``pattern</code>’ and the argument that gives the name of the
field to be completed, the number of the field (starting with one) may
be given after the fieldname, separated from it by a colon.</p>
<p>All arguments after the required field name are passed to <code>compadd</code> when
generating matches from the style value, or to the functions for the
fields if they are called.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcommand_005fnames"></span></p>
<p><code>_command_names</code> [ <code>-e</code> | <code>-</code> ]</p>
<p>This function completes words that are valid at command position: names
of aliases, builtins, hashed commands, functions, and so on. With the
<code>-e</code> flag, only hashed commands are completed. The <code>-</code> flag is ignored.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcomp_005flocale"></span></p>
<p><code>_comp_locale</code></p>
<p>This function resets all the locale categories other than <code>LC_CTYPE</code> to
‘<code>C</code>’ so that the output from external commands can be easily analyzed
by the completion system. <code>LC_CTYPE</code> retains the current value (taking
<code>LC_ALL</code> and <code>LANG</code> into account), ensuring that non-ASCII characters in
file names are still handled properly.</p>
<p>This function should normally be run only in a subshell, because the new
locale is exported to the environment. Typical usage would be
‘<code> $(_comp_locale;  ``command</code> ...<code>)</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fcompleters"></span></p>
<p><code>_completers</code> [ <code>-p</code> ]</p>
<p>This function completes names of completers.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-p</code><br />
Include the leading underscore (‘<code>_</code>’) in the matches.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="index-_005fdescribe"></span></p>
<p><code>_describe </code>[<code>-12JVx</code>] [ <code>-oO</code> | <code>-t</code> <code>tag</code> ] <code>descr</code> <code>name1</code> [
<code>name2</code> ] [ <code>opt</code> ... ]</p>
<p><code>          </code>[ <code>-``-</code> <code>name1</code> [ <code>name2</code> ] [ <code>opt</code> ... ] ... ]</p>
<p>This function associates completions with descriptions. Multiple groups
separated by <code>-``-</code> can be supplied, potentially with different
completion options <code>opt</code>s.</p>
<p>The <code>descr</code> is taken as a string to display above the matches if the
<code>format</code> style for the <code>descriptions</code> tag is set. This is followed by
one or two names of arrays followed by options to pass to <code>compadd</code>. The
array <code>name1</code> contains the possible completions with their descriptions
in the form ‘<code>completion``:``description</code>’. Any literal colons in
<code>completion</code> must be quoted with a backslash. If a <code>name2</code> is given, it
should have the same number of elements as <code>name1</code>; in this case the
corresponding elements are added as possible completions instead of the
<code>completion</code> strings from <code>name1</code>. The completion list will retain the
descriptions from <code>name1</code>. Finally, a set of completion options can
appear.</p>
<p>If the option ‘<code>-o</code>’ appears before the first argument, the matches
added will be treated as names of command options (N.B. not shell
options), typically following a ‘<code>-</code>’, ‘<code>-``-</code>’ or ‘<code>+</code>’ on the command
line. In this case <code>_describe</code> uses the <code>prefix-hidden</code>, <code>prefix-needed</code>
and <code>verbose</code> styles to find out if the strings should be added as
completions and if the descriptions should be shown. Without the ‘<code>-o</code>’
option, only the <code>verbose</code> style is used to decide how descriptions are
shown. If ‘<code>-O</code>’ is used instead of ‘<code>-o</code>’, command options are
completed as above but <code>_describe</code> will not handle the <code>prefix-needed</code>
style.</p>
<p>With the <code>-t</code> option a <code>tag</code> can be specified. The default is ‘<code>values</code>’
or, if the <code>-o</code> option is given, ‘<code>options</code>’.</p>
<p>The options <code>-1</code>, <code>-2</code>, <code>-J</code>, <code>-V</code>, <code>-x</code> are passed to <code>_next_label</code>.</p>
<p>If selected by the <code>list-grouped</code> style, strings with the same
description will appear together in the list.</p>
<p><code>_describe</code> uses the <code>_all_labels</code> function to generate the matches, so
it does not need to appear inside a loop over tag labels.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fdescription"></span></p>
<p><code>_description</code> [ <code>-x</code> ] [ <code>-12VJ</code> ] <code>tag</code> <code>name</code> <code>descr</code> [ <code>spec</code>
... ]</p>
<p>This function is not to be confused with the previous one; it is used as
a helper function for creating options to <code>compadd</code>. It is buried inside
many of the higher level completion functions and so often does not need
to be called directly.</p>
<p>The styles listed below are tested in the current context using the
given <code>tag</code>. The resulting options for <code>compadd</code> are put into the array
named <code>name</code> (this is traditionally ‘<code>expl</code>’, but this convention is not
enforced). The description for the corresponding set of matches is
passed to the function in <code>descr</code>.</p>
<p>The styles tested are: <code>format</code>, <code>hidden</code>, <code>matcher</code>, <code>ignore-line</code>,
<code>ignored-patterns</code>, <code>group-name</code> and <code>sort</code>. The <code>format</code> style is first
tested for the given <code>tag</code> and then for the <code>descriptions</code> tag if no
value was found, while the remainder are only tested for the tag given
as the first argument. The function also calls <code>_setup</code> which tests some
more styles.</p>
<p>The string returned by the <code>format</code> style (if any) will be modified so
that the sequence ‘<code>%d</code>’ is replaced by the <code>descr</code> given as the third
argument without any leading or trailing white space. If, after removing
the white space, the <code>descr</code> is the empty string, the format style will
not be used and the options put into the <code>name</code> array will not contain
an explanation string to be displayed above the matches.</p>
<p>If <code>_description</code> is called with more than three arguments, the
additional <code>spec</code>s should be of the form ‘<code>char``:``str</code>’. These supply
escape sequence replacements for the <code>format</code> style: every appearance of
‘<code>%``char</code>’ will be replaced by <code>string</code>.</p>
<p>If the <code>-x</code> option is given, the description will be passed to <code>compadd</code>
using the <code>-x</code> option instead of the default <code>-X</code>. This means that the
description will be displayed even if there are no corresponding
matches.</p>
<p>The options placed in the array <code>name</code> take account of the <code>group-name</code>
style, so matches are placed in a separate group where necessary. The
group normally has its elements sorted (by passing the option <code>-J</code> to
<code>compadd</code>), but if an option starting with ‘<code>-V</code>’, ‘<code>-J</code>’, ‘<code>-1</code>’, or
‘<code>-2</code>’ is passed to <code>_description</code>, that option will be included in
the array. Hence it is possible for the completion group to be unsorted
by giving the option ‘<code>-V</code>’, ‘<code>-1V</code>’, or ‘<code>-2V</code>’.</p>
<p>In most cases, the function will be used like this:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">local expl
_description files expl file
compadd &quot;$expl[@]&quot; - &quot;$files[@]&quot;
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note the use of the parameter <code>expl</code>, the hyphen, and the list of
matches. Almost all calls to <code>compadd</code> within the completion system use
a similar format; this ensures that user-specified styles are correctly
passed down to the builtins which implement the internals of completion.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fdir_005flist"></span></p>
<p><code>_dir_list</code> [ <code>-s</code> <code>sep</code> ] [ <code>-S</code> ]</p>
<p>Complete a list of directory names separated by colons (the same format
as <code>$PATH</code>).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-s</code> <code>sep</code><br />
Use <code>sep</code> as separator between items. <code>sep</code> defaults to a colon
(‘<code>:</code>’).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-S</code><br />
Add <code>sep</code> instead of slash (‘<code>/</code>’) as an autoremoveable suffix.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="index-_005fdispatch"></span></p>
<p><code>_dispatch</code> <code>context string</code> ...</p>
<p>This sets the current context to <code>context</code> and looks for completion
functions to handle this context by hunting through the list of command
names or special contexts (as described above for <code>compdef</code>) given as
<code>string</code>s. The first completion function to be defined for one of the
contexts in the list is used to generate matches. Typically, the last
<code>string</code> is <code>-default-</code> to cause the function for default completion to
be used as a fallback.</p>
<p>The function sets the parameter <code>$service</code> to the <code>string</code> being tried,
and sets the <code>context/command</code> field (the fourth) of the <code>$curcontext</code>
parameter to the <code>context</code> given as the first argument.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005femail_005faddresses"></span></p>
<p><code>_email_addresses</code> [ <code>-c</code> ] [ <code>-n</code> <code>plugin</code> ]</p>
<p>Complete email addresses. Addresses are provided by plugins.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-c</code><br />
Complete bare <code>localhost@domain.tld</code> addresses, without a name part
or a comment. Without this option, RFC822 ‘<code>Firstname Lastname</code>
<code>&lt;``address``&gt;</code>’ strings are completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-n</code> <code>plugin</code><br />
Complete aliases from <code>plugin</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following plugins are available by default: <code>_email-ldap</code> (see the
<code>filter</code> style), <code>_email-local</code> (completes <code>user``@``hostname</code> Unix
addresses), <code>_email-mail</code> (completes aliases from <code>~/.mailrc</code>),
<code>_email-mush</code>, <code>_email-mutt</code>, and <code>_email-pine</code>.</p>
<p>Addresses from the <code>_email-``foo</code> plugin are added under the tag
‘<code>email-``foo</code>’.</p>
<p><em>Writing plugins</em></p>
<p>Plugins are written as separate functions with names starting with
‘<code>_email-</code>’. They are invoked with the <code>-c</code> option and <code>compadd</code>
options. They should either do their own completion or set the <code>$reply</code>
array to a list of ‘<code>alias``:``address</code>’ elements and return <code>300</code>. New
plugins will be picked up and run automatically.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005ffiles"></span></p>
<p><code>_files</code></p>
<p>The function <code>_files</code> is a wrapper around <code>_path_files</code>. It supports all
of the same functionality, with some enhancements — notably, it respects
the <code>list-dirs-first</code> style, and it allows users to override the
behaviour of the <code>-g</code> and <code>-/</code> options with the <code>file-patterns</code> style.
<code>_files</code> should therefore be preferred over <code>_path_files</code> in most cases.</p>
<p>This function accepts the full set of options allowed by <code>_path_files</code>,
described below.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fgnu_005fgeneric"></span></p>
<p><code>_gnu_generic</code></p>
<p>This function is a simple wrapper around the <code>_arguments</code> function
described above. It can be used to determine automatically the long
options understood by commands that produce a list when passed the
option ‘<code>-``-help</code>’. It is intended to be used as a top-level completion
function in its own right. For example, to enable option completion for
the commands <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, use</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">compdef _gnu_generic foo bar
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>after the call to <code>compinit</code>.</p>
<p>The completion system as supplied is conservative in its use of this
function, since it is important to be sure the command understands the
option ‘<code>-``-help</code>’.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fguard"></span></p>
<p><code>_guard</code> [ <code>options</code> ] <code>pattern descr</code></p>
<p>This function displays <code>descr</code> if <code>pattern</code> matches the string to be
completed. It is intended to be used in the <code>action</code> for the
specifications passed to <code>_arguments</code> and similar functions.</p>
<p>The return status is zero if the message was displayed and the word to
complete is not empty, and non-zero otherwise.</p>
<p>The <code>pattern</code> may be preceded by any of the options understood by
<code>compadd</code> that are passed down from <code>_description</code>, namely <code>-M</code>, <code>-J</code>,
<code>-V</code>, <code>-1</code>, <code>-2</code>, <code>-n</code>, <code>-F</code> and <code>-X</code>. All of these options will be
ignored. This fits in conveniently with the argument-passing conventions
of actions for <code>_arguments</code>.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a command taking the options <code>-n</code> and <code>-none</code>,
where <code>-n</code> must be followed by a numeric value in the same word. By
using:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_arguments '-n-: :_guard &quot;[0-9]#&quot; &quot;numeric value&quot;' '-none'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><code>_arguments</code> can be made to both display the message ‘<code>numeric value</code>’
and complete options after ‘<code>-n&lt;TAB&gt;</code>’. If the ‘<code>-n</code>’ is already
followed by one or more digits (the pattern passed to <code>_guard</code>) only the
message will be displayed; if the ‘<code>-n</code>’ is followed by another
character, only options are completed.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fmessage"></span></p>
<p><code>_message</code> [ <code>-r12</code> ] [ <code>-VJ</code> <code>group</code> ] <code>descr</code></p>
<p><code>_message -e</code> [ <code>tag</code> ] <code>descr</code></p>
<p>The <code>descr</code> is used in the same way as the third argument to the
<code>_description</code> function, except that the resulting string will always be
shown whether or not matches were generated. This is useful for
displaying a help message in places where no completions can be
generated.</p>
<p>The <code>format</code> style is examined with the <code>messages</code> tag to find a
message; the usual tag, <code>descriptions</code>, is used only if the style is not
set with the former.</p>
<p>If the <code>-r</code> option is given, no style is used; the <code>descr</code> is taken
literally as the string to display. This is most useful when the <code>descr</code>
comes from a pre-processed argument list which already contains an
expanded description. Note that this option does not disable the
‘<code>%</code>’-sequence parsing done by <code>compadd</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>-12VJ</code> options and the <code>group</code> are passed to <code>compadd</code> and hence
determine the group the message string is added to.</p>
<p>The second <code>-e</code> form gives a description for completions with the tag
<code>tag</code> to be shown even if there are no matches for that tag. This form
is called by <code>_arguments</code> in the event that there is no action for an
option specification. The tag can be omitted and if so the tag is taken
from the parameter <code>$curtag</code>; this is maintained by the completion
system and so is usually correct. Note that if there are no matches at
the time this function is called, <code>compstate[insert]</code> is cleared, so
additional matches generated later are not inserted on the command line.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fmulti_005fparts"></span></p>
<p><code>_multi_parts</code> [ <code>-i</code> ] <code>sep</code> <code>array</code></p>
<p>The argument <code>sep</code> is a separator character. The <code>array</code> may be either
the name of an array parameter or a literal array in the form ‘<code>(foo bar``)</code>’, a parenthesised list of words separated by whitespace. The
possible completions are the strings from the array. However, each chunk
delimited by <code>sep</code> will be completed separately. For example, the <code>_tar</code>
function uses ‘<code>_multi_parts</code> <code>/</code> <code>patharray</code>’ to complete partial file
paths from the given array of complete file paths.</p>
<p>The <code>-i</code> option causes <code>_multi_parts</code> to insert a unique match even if
that requires multiple separators to be inserted. This is not usually
the expected behaviour with filenames, but certain other types of
completion, for example those with a fixed set of possibilities, may be
more suited to this form.</p>
<p>Like other utility functions, this function accepts the ‘<code>-V</code>’, ‘<code>-J</code>’,
‘<code>-1</code>’, ‘<code>-2</code>’, ‘<code>-n</code>’, ‘<code>-f</code>’, ‘<code>-X</code>’, ‘<code>-M</code>’, ‘<code>-P</code>’, ‘<code>-S</code>’,
‘<code>-r</code>’, ‘<code>-R</code>’, and ‘<code>-q</code>’ options and passes them to the <code>compadd</code>
builtin.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fnext_005flabel"></span></p>
<p><code>_next_label</code> [ <code>-x</code> ] [ <code>-12VJ</code> ] <code>tag</code> <code>name</code> <code>descr</code> [ <code>option</code>
... ]</p>
<p>This function is used to implement the loop over different tag labels
for a particular tag as described above for the <code>tag-order</code> style. On
each call it checks to see if there are any more tag labels; if there is
it returns status zero, otherwise non-zero. As this function requires a
current tag to be set, it must always follow a call to <code>_tags</code> or
<code>_requested</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>-x12VJ</code> options and the first three arguments are passed to the
<code>_description</code> function. Where appropriate the <code>tag</code> will be replaced by
a tag label in this call. Any description given in the <code>tag-order</code> style
is preferred to the <code>descr</code> passed to <code>_next_label</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>option</code>s given after the <code>descr</code> are set in the parameter given by
<code>name</code>, and hence are to be passed to <code>compadd</code> or whatever function is
called to add the matches.</p>
<p>Here is a typical use of this function for the tag <code>foo</code>. The call to
<code>_requested</code> determines if tag <code>foo</code> is required at all; the loop over
<code>_next_label</code> handles any labels defined for the tag in the <code>tag-order</code>
style.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">local expl ret=1
...
if _requested foo; then
  ...
  while _next_label foo expl '...'; do
    compadd &quot;$expl[@]&quot; ... &amp;&amp; ret=0
  done
  ...
fi
return ret
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-_005fnormal"></span></p>
<p><code>_normal</code> [ <code>-P</code> | <code>-p</code> <code>precommand</code> ]</p>
<p>This is the standard function called to handle completion outside any
special <code>-``context``-</code>. It is called both to complete the command word
and also the arguments for a command. In the second case, <code>_normal</code>
looks for a special completion for that command, and if there is none it
uses the completion for the <code>-default-</code> context.</p>
<p>A second use is to reexamine the command line specified by the <code>$words</code>
array and the <code>$CURRENT</code> parameter after those have been modified. For
example, the function <code>_precommand</code>, which completes after precommand
specifiers such as <code>nohup</code>, removes the first word from the <code>words</code>
array, decrements the <code>CURRENT</code> parameter, then calls ‘<code>_normal -p $service</code>’. The effect is that ‘<code>nohup</code> <code>cmd ...</code>’ is treated in the
same way as ‘<code>cmd ...</code>’.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-P</code><br />
Reset the list of precommands. This option should be used if
completing a command line which allows internal commands (e.g.
builtins and functions) regardless of prior precommands (e.g. ‘<code>zsh -c</code>’).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-p</code> <code>precommand</code><br />
Append <code>precommand</code> to the list of precommands. This option should
be used in nearly all cases in which <code>-P</code> is not applicable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the command name matches one of the patterns given by one of the
options <code>-p</code> or <code>-P</code> to <code>compdef</code>, the corresponding completion function
is called and then the parameter <code>_compskip</code> is checked. If it is set
completion is terminated at that point even if no matches have been
found. This is the same effect as in the <code>-first-</code> context.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005foptions"></span></p>
<p><code>_options</code></p>
<p>This can be used to complete the names of shell options. It provides a
matcher specification that ignores a leading ‘<code>no</code>’, ignores underscores
and allows upper-case letters to match their lower-case counterparts
(for example, ‘<code>glob</code>’, ‘<code>noglob</code>’, ‘<code>NO_GLOB</code>’ are all completed). Any
arguments are propagated to the <code>compadd</code> builtin.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005foptions_005fset"></span>
<span id="index-_005foptions_005funset"></span></p>
<p><code>_options_set</code> and <code>_options_unset</code></p>
<p>These functions complete only set or unset options, with the same
matching specification used in the <code>_options</code> function.</p>
<p>Note that you need to uncomment a few lines in the <code>_main_complete</code>
function for these functions to work properly. The lines in question are
used to store the option settings in effect before the completion widget
locally sets the options it needs. Hence these functions are not
generally used by the completion system.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fparameters"></span></p>
<p><code>_parameters</code></p>
<p>This is used to complete the names of shell parameters.</p>
<p>The option ‘<code>-g</code> <code>pattern</code>’ limits the completion to parameters whose
type matches the <code>pattern</code>. The type of a parameter is that shown by
‘<code>print ${(t)``param``}</code>’, hence judicious use of ‘<code>*</code>’ in <code>pattern</code>
is probably necessary.</p>
<p>All other arguments are passed to the <code>compadd</code> builtin.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fpath_005ffiles"></span></p>
<p><code>_path_files</code></p>
<p>This function is used throughout the completion system to complete
filenames. It allows completion of partial paths. For example, the
string ‘<code>/u/i/s/sig</code>’ may be completed to ‘<code>/usr/include/sys/signal.h</code>’.</p>
<p>The options accepted by both <code>_path_files</code> and <code>_files</code> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-f</code><br />
Complete all filenames. This is the default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-/</code><br />
Specifies that only directories should be completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-g</code> <code>pattern</code><br />
Specifies that only files matching the <code>pattern</code> should be
completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-W</code> <code>paths</code><br />
Specifies path prefixes that are to be prepended to the string from
the command line to generate the filenames but that should not be
inserted as completions nor shown in completion listings. Here,
<code>paths</code> may be the name of an array parameter, a literal list of
paths enclosed in parentheses or an absolute pathname.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-F</code> <code>ignored-files</code><br />
This behaves as for the corresponding option to the <code>compadd</code>
builtin. It gives direct control over which filenames should be
ignored. If the option is not present, the <code>ignored-patterns</code> style
is used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both <code>_path_files</code> and <code>_files</code> also accept the following options which
are passed to <code>compadd</code>: ‘<code>-J</code>’, ‘<code>-V</code>’, ‘<code>-1</code>’, ‘<code>-2</code>’, ‘<code>-n</code>’, ‘<code>-X</code>’,
‘<code>-M</code>’, ‘<code>-P</code>’, ‘<code>-S</code>’, ‘<code>-q</code>’, ‘<code>-r</code>’, and ‘<code>-R</code>’.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>_path_files</code> function uses the styles <code>expand</code>,
<code>ambiguous</code>, <code>special-dirs</code>, <code>list-suffixes</code> and <code>file-sort</code> described
above.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fpick_005fvariant"></span></p>
<p><code>_pick_variant </code>[ <code>-b</code> <code>builtin-label</code> ] [ <code>-c</code> <code>command</code> ] [
<code>-r</code> <code>name</code> ]</p>
<p><code>              ``label``=``pattern</code> ... <code>label</code> [ <code>arg</code> ... ]</p>
<p>This function is used to resolve situations where a single command name
requires more than one type of handling, either because it has more than
one variant or because there is a name clash between two different
commands.</p>
<p>The command to run is taken from the first element of the array <code>words</code>
unless this is overridden by the option <code>-c</code>. This command is run and
its output is compared with a series of patterns. Arguments to be passed
to the command can be specified at the end after all the other
arguments. The patterns to try in order are given by the arguments
<code>label``=``pattern</code>; if the output of ‘<code>command</code> <code>arg</code> ...’ contains
<code>pattern</code>, then <code>label</code> is selected as the label for the command
variant. If none of the patterns match, the final command label is
selected and status 1 is returned.</p>
<p>If the ‘<code>-b</code> <code>builtin-label</code>’ is given, the command is tested to see if
it is provided as a shell builtin, possibly autoloaded; if so, the label
<code>builtin-label</code> is selected as the label for the variant.</p>
<p>If the ‘<code>-r</code> <code>name</code>’ is given, the <code>label</code> picked is stored in the
parameter named <code>name</code>.</p>
<p>The results are also cached in the <code>_cmd_variant</code> associative array
indexed by the name of the command run.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fregex_005farguments"></span></p>
<p><code>_regex_arguments</code> <code>name</code> <code>spec</code> ...</p>
<p>This function generates a completion function <code>name</code> which matches the
specifications <code>spec</code>s, a set of regular expressions as described below.
After running <code>_regex_arguments</code>, the function <code>name</code> should be called
as a normal completion function. The pattern to be matched is given by
the contents of the <code>words</code> array up to the current cursor position
joined together with null characters; no quotation is applied.</p>
<p>The arguments are grouped as sets of alternatives separated by ‘<code>|</code>’,
which are tried one after the other until one matches. Each alternative
consists of a one or more specifications which are tried left to right,
with each pattern matched being stripped in turn from the command line
being tested, until all of the group succeeds or until one fails; in the
latter case, the next alternative is tried. This structure can be
repeated to arbitrary depth by using parentheses; matching proceeds from
inside to outside.</p>
<p>A special procedure is applied if no test succeeds but the remaining
command line string contains no null character (implying the remaining
word is the one for which completions are to be generated). The
completion target is restricted to the remaining word and any <code>action</code>s
for the corresponding patterns are executed. In this case, nothing is
stripped from the command line string. The order of evaluation of the
<code>action</code>s can be determined by the <code>tag-order</code> style; the various
formats supported by <code>_alternative</code> can be used in <code>action</code>. The <code>descr</code>
is used for setting up the array parameter <code>expl</code>.</p>
<p>Specification arguments take one of following forms, in which
metacharacters such as ‘<code>(</code>’, ‘<code>)</code>’, ‘<code>#</code>’ and ‘<code>|</code>’ should be quoted.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>/``pattern``/</code> [<code>%``lookahead``%</code>] [<code>-``guard</code>]
[<code>:``tag``:``descr``:``action</code>]<br />
This is a single primitive component. The function tests whether the
combined pattern ‘<code>(#b)((#B)``pattern``)``lookahead``*</code>’ matches the
command line string. If so, ‘<code>guard</code>’ is evaluated and its return
status is examined to determine if the test has succeeded. The
<code>pattern</code> string ‘<code>[]</code>’ is guaranteed never to match. The
<code>lookahead</code> is not stripped from the command line before the next
pattern is examined.</p>
<p>The argument starting with <code>:</code> is used in the same manner as an
argument to <code>_alternative</code>.</p>
<p>A component is used as follows: <code>pattern</code> is tested to see if the
component already exists on the command line. If it does, any
following specifications are examined to find something to complete.
If a component is reached but no such pattern exists yet on the
command line, the string containing the <code>action</code> is used to generate
matches to insert at that point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/``pattern``/+</code> [<code>%``lookahead``%</code>] [<code>-``guard</code>]
[<code>:``tag``:``descr``:``action</code>]<br />
This is similar to ‘<code>/``pattern``/</code> ...’ but the left part of the
command line string (i.e. the part already matched by previous
patterns) is also considered part of the completion target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/``pattern``/-</code> [<code>%``lookahead``%</code>] [<code>-``guard</code>]
[<code>:``tag``:``descr``:``action</code>]<br />
This is similar to ‘<code>/``pattern``/</code> ...’ but the <code>action</code>s of the
current and previously matched patterns are ignored even if the
following ‘<code>pattern</code>’ matches the empty string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>(</code> <code>spec</code> <code>)</code><br />
Parentheses may be used to groups <code>spec</code>s; note each parenthesis is
a single argument to <code>_regex_arguments</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>spec</code> <code>#</code><br />
This allows any number of repetitions of <code>spec</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>spec</code> <code>spec</code><br />
The two <code>spec</code>s are to be matched one after the other as described
above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>spec</code> <code>|</code> <code>spec</code><br />
Either of the two <code>spec</code>s can be matched.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The function <code>_regex_words</code> can be used as a helper function to generate
matches for a set of alternative words possibly with their own arguments
as a command line argument.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_regex_arguments _tst /$'[^\0]#\0'/ \ 
    /$'[^\0]#\0'/ :'compadd aaa'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This generates a function <code>_tst</code> that completes <code>aaa</code> as its only
argument. The <code>tag</code> and <code>description</code> for the action have been omitted
for brevity (this works but is not recommended in normal use). The first
component matches the command word, which is arbitrary; the second
matches any argument. As the argument is also arbitrary, any following
component would not depend on <code>aaa</code> being present.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_regex_arguments _tst /$'[^\0]#\0'/ \ 
    /$'aaa\0'/ :'compadd aaa'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This is a more typical use; it is similar, but any following patterns
would only match if <code>aaa</code> was present as the first argument.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_regex_arguments _tst /$'[^\0]#\0'/ \( \ 
    /$'aaa\0'/ :'compadd aaa' \ 
    /$'bbb\0'/ :'compadd bbb' \) \#
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In this example, an indefinite number of command arguments may be
completed. Odd arguments are completed as <code>aaa</code> and even arguments as
<code>bbb</code>. Completion fails unless the set of <code>aaa</code> and <code>bbb</code> arguments
before the current one is matched correctly.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_regex_arguments _tst /$'[^\0]#\0'/ \ 
    \( /$'aaa\0'/ :'compadd aaa' \| \ 
    /$'bbb\0'/ :'compadd bbb' \) \#
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This is similar, but either <code>aaa</code> or <code>bbb</code> may be completed for any
argument. In this case <code>_regex_words</code> could be used to generate</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fregex_005fwords-_005b-_002dt-term-_005d"></span></p>
<p><code>_regex_words</code> <code>tag</code> <code>description</code> <code>spec</code> ...</p>
<p>This function can be used to generate arguments for the
<code>_regex_arguments</code> command which may be inserted at any point where a
set of rules is expected. The <code>tag</code> and <code>description</code> give a standard
tag and description pertaining to the current context. Each <code>spec</code>
contains two or three arguments separated by a colon: note that there is
no leading colon in this case.</p>
<p>Each <code>spec</code> gives one of a set of words that may be completed at this
point, together with arguments. It is thus roughly equivalent to the
<code>_arguments</code> function when used in normal (non-regex) completion.</p>
<p>The part of the <code>spec</code> before the first colon is the word to be
completed. This may contain a <code>*</code>; the entire word, before and after the
<code>*</code> is completed, but only the text before the <code>*</code> is required for the
context to be matched, so that further arguments may be completed after
the abbreviated form.</p>
<p>The second part of <code>spec</code> is a description for the word being completed.</p>
<p>The optional third part of the <code>spec</code> describes how words following the
one being completed are themselves to be completed. It will be evaluated
in order to avoid problems with quoting. This means that typically it
contains a reference to an array containing previously generated regex
arguments.</p>
<p>The option <code>-t</code> <code>term</code> specifies a terminator for the word instead of
the usual space. This is handled as an auto-removable suffix in the
manner of the option <code>-s</code> <code>sep</code> to <code>_values</code>.</p>
<p>The result of the processing by <code>_regex_words</code> is placed in the array
<code>reply</code>, which should be made local to the calling function. If the set
of words and arguments may be matched repeatedly, a <code>#</code> should be
appended to the generated array at that point.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">local -a reply
_regex_words mydb-commands 'mydb commands' \ 
  'add:add an entry to mydb:$mydb_add_cmds' \ 
  'show:show entries in mydb'
_regex_arguments _mydb &quot;$reply[@]&quot;
_mydb &quot;$@&quot;
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This shows a completion function for a command <code>mydb</code> which takes two
command arguments, <code>add</code> and <code>show</code>. <code>show</code> takes no arguments, while
the arguments for <code>add</code> have already been prepared in an array
<code>mydb_add_cmds</code>, quite possibly by a previous call to <code>_regex_words</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005frequested"></span></p>
<p><code>_requested</code> [ <code>-x</code> ] [ <code>-12VJ</code> ] <code>tag</code> [ <code>name</code> <code>descr</code> [
<code>command</code> [ <code>arg</code> ... ] ]</p>
<p>This function is called to decide whether a tag already registered by a
call to <code>_tags</code> (see below) has been requested by the user and hence
completion should be performed for it. It returns status zero if the tag
is requested and non-zero otherwise. The function is typically used as
part of a loop over different tags as follows:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_tags foo bar baz
while _tags; do
  if _requested foo; then
    ... # perform completion for foo
  fi
  ... # test the tags bar and baz in the same way
  ... # exit loop if matches were generated
done
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note that the test for whether matches were generated is not performed
until the end of the <code>_tags</code> loop. This is so that the user can set the
<code>tag-order</code> style to specify a set of tags to be completed at the same
time.</p>
<p>If <code>name</code> and <code>descr</code> are given, <code>_requested</code> calls the <code>_description</code>
function with these arguments together with the options passed to
<code>_requested</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>command</code> is given, the <code>_all_labels</code> function will be called
immediately with the same arguments. In simple cases this makes it
possible to perform the test for the tag and the matching in one go. For
example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">local expl ret=1
_tags foo bar baz
while _tags; do
  _requested foo expl 'description' \ 
      compadd foobar foobaz &amp;&amp; ret=0
  ...
  (( ret )) || break
done
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If the <code>command</code> is not <code>compadd</code>, it must nevertheless be prepared to
handle the same options.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fretrieve_005fcache"></span></p>
<p><code>_retrieve_cache</code> <code>cache_identifier</code></p>
<p>This function retrieves completion information from the file given by
<code>cache_identifier</code>, stored in a directory specified by the <code>cache-path</code>
style which defaults to <code>~/.zcompcache</code>. The return status is zero if
retrieval was successful. It will only attempt retrieval if the
<code>use-cache</code> style is set, so you can call this function without worrying
about whether the user wanted to use the caching layer.</p>
<p>See <code>_store_cache</code> below for more details.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fsep_005fparts"></span></p>
<p><code>_sep_parts</code></p>
<p>This function is passed alternating arrays and separators as arguments.
The arrays specify completions for parts of strings to be separated by
the separators. The arrays may be the names of array parameters or a
quoted list of words in parentheses. For example, with the array
‘<code>hosts=(ftp news)</code>’ the call ‘<code>_sep_parts ’(foo bar)’ @ hosts</code>’ will
complete the string ‘<code>f</code>’ to ‘<code>foo</code>’ and the string ‘<code>b@n</code>’ to
‘<code>bar@news</code>’.</p>
<p>This function accepts the <code>compadd</code> options ‘<code>-V</code>’, ‘<code>-J</code>’, ‘<code>-1</code>’,
‘<code>-2</code>’, ‘<code>-n</code>’, ‘<code>-X</code>’, ‘<code>-M</code>’, ‘<code>-P</code>’, ‘<code>-S</code>’, ‘<code>-r</code>’, ‘<code>-R</code>’, and
‘<code>-q</code>’ and passes them on to the <code>compadd</code> builtin used to add the
matches.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fsequence"></span></p>
<p><code>_sequence</code> [ <code>-s</code> <code>sep</code> ] [ <code>-n</code> <code>max</code> ] [ <code>-d</code> ] <code>function</code> [
<code>-</code> ] ...</p>
<p>This function is a wrapper to other functions for completing items in a
separated list. The same function is used to complete each item in the
list. The separator is specified with the <code>-s</code> option. If <code>-s</code> is
omitted it will use ‘<code>,</code>’. Duplicate values are not matched unless <code>-d</code>
is specified. If there is a fixed or maximum number of items in the
list, this can be specified with the <code>-n</code> option.</p>
<p>Common <code>compadd</code> options are passed on to the function. It is possible
to use <code>compadd</code> directly with <code>_sequence</code>, though <code>_values</code> may be more
appropriate in this situation.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fsetup"></span></p>
<p><code>_setup</code> <code>tag</code> [ <code>group</code> ]</p>
<p>This function sets up the special parameters used by the completion
system appropriately for the <code>tag</code> given as the first argument. It uses
the styles <code>list-colors</code>, <code>list-packed</code>, <code>list-rows-first</code>,
<code>last-prompt</code>, <code>accept-exact</code>, <code>menu</code> and <code>force-list</code>.</p>
<p>The optional <code>group</code> supplies the name of the group in which the matches
will be placed. If it is not given, the <code>tag</code> is used as the group name.</p>
<p>This function is called automatically from <code>_description</code> and hence is
not normally called explicitly.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fstore_005fcache"></span></p>
<p><code>_store_cache</code> <code>cache_identifier</code> <code>param</code> ...</p>
<p>This function, together with <code>_retrieve_cache</code> and <code>_cache_invalid</code>,
implements a caching layer which can be used in any completion function.
Data obtained by costly operations are stored in parameters; this
function then dumps the values of those parameters to a file. The data
can then be retrieved quickly from that file via <code>_retrieve_cache</code>, even
in different instances of the shell.</p>
<p>The <code>cache_identifier</code> specifies the file which the data should be
dumped to. The file is stored in a directory specified by the
<code>cache-path</code> style which defaults to <code>~/.zcompcache</code>. The remaining
<code>param</code>s arguments are the parameters to dump to the file.</p>
<p>The return status is zero if storage was successful. The function will
only attempt storage if the <code>use-cache</code> style is set, so you can call
this function without worrying about whether the user wanted to use the
caching layer.</p>
<p>The completion function may avoid calling <code>_retrieve_cache</code> when it
already has the completion data available as parameters. However, in
that case it should call <code>_cache_invalid</code> to check whether the data in
the parameters and in the cache are still valid.</p>
<p>See the _perl_modules completion function for a simple example of the
usage of the caching layer.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005ftags"></span></p>
<p><code>_tags</code> [ [ <code>-C</code> <code>name</code> ] <code>tag</code> ... ]</p>
<p>If called with arguments, these are taken to be the names of tags valid
for completions in the current context. These tags are stored internally
and sorted by using the <code>tag-order</code> style.</p>
<p>Next, <code>_tags</code> is called repeatedly without arguments from the same
completion function. This successively selects the first, second, etc.
set of tags requested by the user. The return status is zero if at least
one of the tags is requested and non-zero otherwise. To test if a
particular tag is to be tried, the <code>_requested</code> function should be
called (see above).</p>
<p>If ‘<code>-C</code> <code>name</code>’ is given, <code>name</code> is temporarily stored in the
<code>argument</code> field (the fifth) of the context in the <code>curcontext</code>
parameter during the call to <code>_tags</code>; the field is restored on exit.
This allows <code>_tags</code> to use a more specific context without having to
change and reset the <code>curcontext</code> parameter (which has the same effect).</p>
<p><span id="index-_005ftilde_005ffiles"></span></p>
<p><code>_tilde_files</code></p>
<p>Like <code>_files</code>, but resolve leading tildes according to the rules of
filename expansion, so the suggested completions don’t start with a
‘<code>~</code>’ even if the filename on the command-line does.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fvalues"></span></p>
<p><code>_values</code> [ <code>-O</code> <code>name</code> ] [ <code>-s</code> <code>sep</code> ] [ <code>-S</code> <code>sep</code> ] [ <code>-wC</code>
] <code>desc</code> <code>spec</code> ...</p>
<p>This is used to complete arbitrary keywords (values) and their
arguments, or lists of such combinations.</p>
<p>If the first argument is the option ‘<code>-O</code> <code>name</code>’, it will be used in
the same way as by the <code>_arguments</code> function. In other words, the
elements of the <code>name</code> array will be passed to <code>compadd</code> when executing
an action.</p>
<p>If the first argument (or the first argument after ‘<code>-O</code> <code>name</code>’) is
‘<code>-s</code>’, the next argument is used as the character that separates
multiple values. This character is automatically added after each value
in an auto-removable fashion (see below); all values completed by
‘<code>_values -s</code>’ appear in the same word on the command line, unlike
completion using <code>_arguments</code>. If this option is not present, only a
single value will be completed per word.</p>
<p>Normally, <code>_values</code> will only use the current word to determine which
values are already present on the command line and hence are not to be
completed again. If the <code>-w</code> option is given, other arguments are
examined as well.</p>
<p>The first non-option argument, <code>desc</code>, is used as a string to print as a
description before listing the values.</p>
<p>All other arguments describe the possible values and their arguments in
the same format used for the description of options by the <code>_arguments</code>
function (see above). The only differences are that no minus or plus
sign is required at the beginning, values can have only one argument,
and the forms of action beginning with an equal sign are not supported.</p>
<p>The character separating a value from its argument can be set using the
option <code>-S</code> (like <code>-s</code>, followed by the character to use as the
separator in the next argument). By default the equals sign will be used
as the separator between values and arguments.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">_values -s , 'description' \ 
        '*foo[bar]' \ 
        '(two)*one[number]:first count:' \ 
        'two[another number]::second count:(1 2 3)'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This describes three possible values: ‘<code>foo</code>’, ‘<code>one</code>’, and ‘<code>two</code>’. The
first is described as ‘<code>bar</code>’, takes no argument and may appear more
than once. The second is described as ‘<code>number</code>’, may appear more than
once, and takes one mandatory argument described as ‘<code>first count</code>’; no
action is specified, so it will not be completed. The ‘<code>(two)</code>’ at the
beginning says that if the value ‘<code>one</code>’ is on the line, the value
‘<code>two</code>’ will no longer be considered a possible completion. Finally,
the last value (‘<code>two</code>’) is described as ‘<code>another number</code>’ and takes an
optional argument described as ‘<code>second count</code>’ for which the
completions (to appear after an ‘<code>=</code>’) are ‘<code>1</code>’, ‘<code>2</code>’, and ‘<code>3</code>’. The
<code>_values</code> function will complete lists of these values separated by
commas.</p>
<p>Like <code>_arguments</code>, this function temporarily adds another context name
component to the arguments element (the fifth) of the current context
while executing the <code>action</code>. Here this name is just the name of the
value for which the argument is completed.</p>
<p>The style <code>verbose</code> is used to decide if the descriptions for the values
(but not those for the arguments) should be printed.</p>
<p>The associative array <code>val_args</code> is used to report values and their
arguments; this works similarly to the <code>opt_args</code> associative array used
by <code>_arguments</code>. Hence the function calling <code>_values</code> should declare the
local parameters <code>state</code>, <code>state_descr</code>, <code>line</code>, <code>context</code> and
<code>val_args</code>:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">local context state state_descr line
typeset -A val_args
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>when using an action of the form ‘<code>-&gt;``string</code>’. With this function the
<code>context</code> parameter will be set to the name of the value whose argument
is to be completed. Note that for <code>_values</code>, the <code>state</code> and
<code>state_descr</code> are scalars rather than arrays. Only a single matching
state is returned.</p>
<p>Note also that <code>_values</code> normally adds the character used as the
separator between values as an auto-removable suffix (similar to a ‘<code>/</code>’
after a directory). However, this is not possible for a ‘<code>-&gt;``string</code>’
action as the matches for the argument are generated by the calling
function. To get the usual behaviour, the calling function can add the
separator <code>x</code> as a suffix by passing the options ‘<code>-qS</code> <code>x</code>’ either
directly or indirectly to <code>compadd</code>.</p>
<p>The option <code>-C</code> is treated in the same way as it is by <code>_arguments</code>. In
that case the parameter <code>curcontext</code> should be made local instead of
<code>context</code> (as described above).</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fwanted"></span></p>
<p><code>_wanted</code> [ <code>-x</code> ] [ <code>-C</code> <code>name</code> ] [ <code>-12VJ</code> ] <code>tag</code> <code>name</code>
<code>descr</code> <code>command</code> [ <code>arg</code> ...]</p>
<p>In many contexts, completion can only generate one particular set of
matches, usually corresponding to a single tag. However, it is still
necessary to decide whether the user requires matches of this type. This
function is useful in such a case.</p>
<p>The arguments to <code>_wanted</code> are the same as those to <code>_requested</code>, i.e.
arguments to be passed to <code>_description</code>. However, in this case the
<code>command</code> is not optional; all the processing of tags, including the
loop over both tags and tag labels and the generation of matches, is
carried out automatically by <code>_wanted</code>.</p>
<p>Hence to offer only one tag and immediately add the corresponding
matches with the given description:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-example">local expl
_wanted tag expl 'description' \ 
    compadd matches...
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note that, as for <code>_requested</code>, the <code>command</code> must be able to accept
options to be passed down to <code>compadd</code>.</p>
<p>Like <code>_tags</code> this function supports the <code>-C</code> option to give a different
name for the argument context field. The <code>-x</code> option has the same
meaning as for <code>_description</code>.</p>
<p><span id="index-_005fwidgets"></span></p>
<p><code>_widgets</code> [ <code>-g</code> <code>pattern</code> ]</p>
<p>This function completes names of zle widgets (see
<a href="Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Zle-Widgets">Widgets</a>). The <code>pattern</code>, if present,
is matched against values of the <code>$widgets</code> special parameter,
documented in <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fzleparameter-Module">The zsh/zleparameter
Module</a>.</p>

<h2 id="207-completion-system-variables"><a class="header" href="#207-completion-system-variables">20.7 Completion System Variables</a></h2>
<p><span id="index-completion-system_002c-variables"></span></p>
<p>There are some standard variables, initialised by the <code>_main_complete</code>
function and then used from other functions.</p>
<p>The standard variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>_comp_caller_options</code><br />
The completion system uses <code>setopt</code> to set a number of options. This
allows functions to be written without concern for compatibility
with every possible combination of user options. However, sometimes
completion needs to know what the user’s option preferences are.
These are saved in the <code>_comp_caller_options</code> associative array.
Option names, spelled in lowercase without underscores, are mapped
to one or other of the strings ‘<code>on</code>’ and ‘<code>off</code>’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>_comp_priv_prefix</code><br />
Completion functions such as <code>_sudo</code> can set the <code>_comp_priv_prefix</code>
array to a command prefix that may then be used by <code>_call_program</code>
to match the privileges when calling programs to generate matches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Two more features are offered by the <code>_main_complete</code> function. The
arrays <code>compprefuncs</code> and <code>comppostfuncs</code> may contain names of functions
that are to be called immediately before or after completion has been
tried. A function will only be called once unless it explicitly
reinserts itself into the array.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Completion-Directories"></span>
<span id="Completion-Directories-1"></span></p>
<h2 id="208-completion-directories"><a class="header" href="#208-completion-directories">20.8 Completion Directories</a></h2>
<p><span id="index-completion-system_002c-directory-structure"></span></p>
<p>In the source distribution, the files are contained in various
subdirectories of the <code>Completion</code> directory. They may have been
installed in the same structure, or into one single function directory.
The following is a description of the files found in the original
directory structure. If you wish to alter an installed file, you will
need to copy it to some directory which appears earlier in your <code>fpath</code>
than the standard directory where it appears.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Base</code><br />
The core functions and special completion widgets automatically
bound to keys. You will certainly need most of these, though will
probably not need to alter them. Many of these are documented above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Zsh</code><br />
Functions for completing arguments of shell builtin commands and
utility functions for this. Some of these are also used by functions
from the <code>Unix</code> directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Unix</code><br />
Functions for completing arguments of external commands and suites
of commands. They may need modifying for your system, although in
many cases some attempt is made to decide which version of a command
is present. For example, completion for the <code>mount</code> command tries to
determine the system it is running on, while completion for many
other utilities try to decide whether the GNU version of the command
is in use, and hence whether the <code>-``-help</code> option is supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>X</code>, <code>AIX</code>, <code>BSD</code>, ...<br />
Completion and utility function for commands available only on some
systems. These are not arranged hierarchically, so, for example,
both the <code>Linux</code> and <code>Debian</code> directories, as well as the <code>X</code>
directory, may be useful on your system.</p>
