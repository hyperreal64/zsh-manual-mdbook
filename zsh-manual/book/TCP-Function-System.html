<p>A module zsh/net/tcp is provided to provide network I/O over TCP/IP from
within the shell; see its description in <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#Zsh-Modules">Zsh
Modules</a>. This manual page describes a
function suite based on the module. If the module is installed, the
functions are usually installed at the same time, in which case they
will be available for autoloading in the default function search path.
In addition to the zsh/net/tcp module, the zsh/zselect module is used to
implement timeouts on read operations. For troubleshooting tips, consult
the corresponding advice for the zftp functions described in <a href="Zftp-Function-System.html#Zftp-Function-System">Zftp
Function System</a>.</p>
<p>There are functions corresponding to the basic I/O operations open,
close, read and send, named tcp_open etc., as well as a function
tcp_expect for pattern match analysis of data read as input. The system
makes it easy to receive data from and send data to multiple named
sessions at once. In addition, it can be linked with the shell’s line
editor in such a way that input data is automatically shown at the
terminal. Other facilities available including logging, filtering and
configurable output prompts.</p>
<p>To use the system where it is available, it should be enough to
‘autoload -U tcp_open’ and run tcp_open as documented below to start a
session. The tcp_open function will autoload the remaining functions.</p>

<p><span id="index-tcp_005fopen"></span></p>
<p>tcp_open [ -qz ] <code>host port</code> [ <code>sess</code> ]</p>
<p>tcp_open [ -qz ] [ -s <code>sess</code> | -l <code>sess</code>[,...] ] ...</p>
<p>tcp_open [ -qz ] [ -a <code>fd</code> | -f <code>fd</code> ] [ <code>sess</code> ]</p>
<p>Open a new session. In the first and simplest form, open a TCP
connection to host <code>host</code> at port <code>port</code>; numeric and symbolic forms are
understood for both.</p>
<p>If <code>sess</code> is given, this becomes the name of the session which can be
used to refer to multiple different TCP connections. If <code>sess</code> is not
given, the function will invent a numeric name value (note this is <em>not</em>
the same as the file descriptor to which the session is attached). It is
recommended that session names not include ‘funny’ characters, where
funny characters are not well-defined but certainly do not include
alphanumerics or underscores, and certainly do include whitespace.</p>
<p>In the second case, one or more sessions to be opened are given by name.
A single session name is given after -s and a comma-separated list after
-l; both options may be repeated as many times as necessary. A failure
to open any session causes tcp_open to abort. The host and port are read
from the file .ztcp_sessions in the same directory as the user’s zsh
initialisation files, i.e. usually the home directory, but $ZDOTDIR if
that is set. The file consists of lines each giving a session name and
the corresponding host and port, in that order (note the session name
comes first, not last), separated by whitespace.</p>
<p>The third form allows passive and fake TCP connections. If the option -a
is used, its argument is a file descriptor open for listening for
connections. No function front-end is provided to open such a file
descriptor, but a call to ‘ztcp -l <code>port</code>’ will create one with the file
descriptor stored in the parameter $REPLY. The listening port can be
closed with ‘ztcp -c <code>fd</code>’. A call to ‘tcp_open -a <code>fd</code>’ will block
until a remote TCP connection is made to <code>port</code> on the local machine. At
this point, a session is created in the usual way and is largely
indistinguishable from an active connection created with one of the
first two forms.</p>
<p>If the option -f is used, its argument is a file descriptor which is
used directly as if it were a TCP session. How well the remainder of the
TCP function system copes with this depends on what actually underlies
this file descriptor. A regular file is likely to be unusable; a FIFO
(pipe) of some sort will work better, but note that it is not a good
idea for two different sessions to attempt to read from the same FIFO at
once.</p>
<p>If the option -q is given with any of the three forms, tcp_open will not
print informational messages, although it will in any case exit with an
appropriate status.</p>
<p>If the line editor (zle) is in use, which is typically the case if the
shell is interactive, tcp_open installs a handler inside zle which will
check for new data at the same time as it checks for keyboard input.
This is convenient as the shell consumes no CPU time while waiting; the
test is performed by the operating system. Giving the option -z to any
of the forms of tcp_open prevents the handler from being installed, so
data must be read explicitly. Note, however, this is not necessary for
executing complete sets of send and read commands from a function, as
zle is not active at this point. Generally speaking, the handler is only
active when the shell is waiting for input at a command prompt or in the
vared builtin. The option has no effect if zle is not active; ‘[[ -o
zle]]’ will test for this.</p>
<p>The first session to be opened becomes the current session and
subsequent calls to tcp_open do not change it. The current session is
stored in the parameter $TCP_SESS; see below for more detail about the
parameters used by the system.</p>
<p>The function tcp_on_open, if defined, is called when a session is
opened. See the description below.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fclose"></span></p>
<p>tcp_close [ -qn ] [ -a | -l <code>sess</code>[,...] | <code>sess</code> ... ]</p>
<p>Close the named sessions, or the current session if none is given, or
all open sessions if -a is given. The options -l and -s are both handled
for consistency with tcp_open, although the latter is redundant.</p>
<p>If the session being closed is the current one, $TCP_SESS is unset,
leaving no current session, even if there are other sessions still open.</p>
<p>If the session was opened with tcp_open -f, the file descriptor is
closed so long as it is in the range 0 to 9 accessible directly from the
command line. If the option -n is given, no attempt will be made to
close file descriptors in this case. The -n option is not used for
genuine ztcp session; the file descriptors are always closed with the
session.</p>
<p>If the option -q is given, no informational messages will be printed.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fread"></span></p>
<p>tcp_read [ -bdq ] [ -t <code>TO</code> ] [ -T <code>TO</code> ]</p>
<p>         [ -a | -u <code>fd</code>[,...] | -l <code>sess</code>[,...] | -s <code>sess</code> ...
]</p>
<p>Perform a read operation on the current session, or on a list of
sessions if any are given with -u, -l or -s, or all open sessions if the
option -a is given. Any of the -u, -l or -s options may be repeated or
mixed together. The -u option specifies a file descriptor directly (only
those managed by this system are useful), the other two specify sessions
as described for tcp_open above.</p>
<p>The function checks for new data available on all the sessions listed.
Unless the -b option is given, it will not block waiting for new data.
Any one line of data from any of the available sessions will be read,
stored in the parameter $TCP_LINE, and displayed to standard output
unless $TCP_SILENT contains a non-empty string. When printed to standard
output the string $TCP_PROMPT will be shown at the start of the line;
the default form for this includes the name of the session being read.
See below for more information on these parameters. In this mode,
tcp_read can be called repeatedly until it returns status 2 which
indicates all pending input from all specified sessions has been
handled.</p>
<p>With the option -b, equivalent to an infinite timeout, the function will
block until a line is available to read from one of the specified
sessions. However, only a single line is returned.</p>
<p>The option -d indicates that all pending input should be drained. In
this case tcp_read may process multiple lines in the manner given above;
only the last is stored in $TCP_LINE, but the complete set is stored in
the array $tcp_lines. This is cleared at the start of each call to
tcp_read.</p>
<p>The options -t and -T specify a timeout in seconds, which may be a
floating point number for increased accuracy. With -t the timeout is
applied before each line read. With -T, the timeout applies to the
overall operation, possibly including multiple read operations if the
option -d is present; without this option, there is no distinction
between -t and -T.</p>
<p>The function does not print informational messages, but if the option -q
is given, no error message is printed for a non-existent session.</p>
<p>A return status of 2 indicates a timeout or no data to read. Any other
non-zero return status indicates some error condition.</p>
<p>See tcp_log for how to control where data is sent by tcp_read.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fsend"></span></p>
<p>tcp_send [ -cnq ] [ -s <code>sess</code> | -l <code>sess</code>[,...] ] <code>data</code> ...</p>
<p>tcp_send [ -cnq ] -a <code>data</code> ...</p>
<p>Send the supplied data strings to all the specified sessions in turn.
The underlying operation differs little from a ‘print -r’ to the
session’s file descriptor, although it attempts to prevent the shell
from dying owing to a SIGPIPE caused by an attempt to write to a defunct
session.</p>
<p>The option -c causes tcp_send to behave like cat. It reads lines from
standard input until end of input and sends them in turn to the
specified session(s) exactly as if they were given as <code>data</code> arguments
to individual tcp_send commands.</p>
<p>The option -n prevents tcp_send from putting a newline at the end of the
data strings.</p>
<p>The remaining options all behave as for tcp_read.</p>
<p>The data arguments are not further processed once they have been passed
to tcp_send; they are simply passed down to print -r.</p>
<p>If the parameter $TCP_OUTPUT is a non-empty string and logging is
enabled then the data sent to each session will be echoed to the log
file(s) with $TCP_OUTPUT in front where appropriate, much in the manner
of $TCP_PROMPT.</p>

<h3 id="2422-session-management"><a class="header" href="#2422-session-management">24.2.2 Session Management</a></h3>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005falias"></span></p>
<p>tcp_alias [ -q ] <code>alias</code>=<code>sess</code> ...</p>
<p>tcp_alias [ -q ] [ <code>alias</code> ... ]</p>
<p>tcp_alias -d [ -q ] <code>alias</code> ...</p>
<p>This function is not particularly well tested.</p>
<p>The first form creates an alias for a session name; <code>alias</code> can then be
used to refer to the existing session <code>sess</code>. As many aliases may be
listed as required.</p>
<p>The second form lists any aliases specified, or all aliases if none.</p>
<p>The third form deletes all the aliases listed. The underlying sessions
are not affected.</p>
<p>The option -q suppresses an inconsistently chosen subset of error
messages.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005flog"></span></p>
<p>tcp_log [ -asc ] [ -n | -N ] [ <code>logfile</code> ]</p>
<p>With an argument <code>logfile</code>, all future input from tcp_read will be
logged to the named file. Unless -a (append) is given, this file will
first be truncated or created empty. With no arguments, show the current
status of logging.</p>
<p>With the option -s, per-session logging is enabled. Input from tcp_read
is output to the file <code>logfile</code>.<code>sess</code>. As the session is automatically
discriminated by the filename, the contents are raw (no $TCP_PROMPT).
The option -a applies as above. Per-session logging and logging of all
data in one file are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>The option -c closes all logging, both complete and per-session logs.</p>
<p>The options -n and -N respectively turn off or restore output of data
read by tcp_read to standard output; hence ‘tcp_log -cn’ turns off all
output by tcp_read.</p>
<p>The function is purely a convenient front end to setting the parameters
$TCP_LOG, $TCP_LOG_SESS, $TCP_SILENT, which are described below.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005frename"></span></p>
<p>tcp_rename <code>old</code> <code>new</code></p>
<p>Rename session <code>old</code> to session <code>new</code>. The old name becomes invalid.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fsess"></span></p>
<p>tcp_sess [ <code>sess</code> [ <code>command</code> [ <code>arg</code> ... ] ] ]</p>
<p>With no arguments, list all the open sessions and associated file
descriptors. The current session is marked with a star. For use in
functions, direct access to the parameters $tcp_by_name, $tcp_by_fd and
$TCP_SESS is probably more convenient; see below.</p>
<p>With a <code>sess</code> argument, set the current session to <code>sess</code>. This is
equivalent to changing $TCP_SESS directly.</p>
<p>With additional arguments, temporarily set the current session while
executing ‘<code>command</code> <code>arg</code> ...’. <code>command</code> is re-evaluated so as to
expand aliases etc., but the remaining <code>arg</code>s are passed through as that
appear to tcp_sess. The original session is restored when tcp_sess

<p>tcp_command <code>send-option</code> ... <code>send-argument</code> ...</p>
<p>This is a convenient front-end to tcp_send. All arguments are passed to
tcp_send, then the function pauses waiting for data. While data is
arriving at least every $TCP_TIMEOUT (default 0.3) seconds, data is
handled and printed out according to the current settings. Status 0 is
always returned.</p>
<p>This is generally only useful for interactive use, to prevent the
display becoming fragmented by output returned from the connection.
Within a programme or function it is generally better to handle reading
data by a more explicit method.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fexpect"></span></p>
<p>tcp_expect [ -q ] [ -p <code>var</code> | -P <code>var</code> ] [ -t <code>TO</code> | -T <code>TO</code> ]</p>
<p>           [ -a | -s <code>sess</code> | -l <code>sess</code>[,...] ] <code>pattern</code> ...</p>
<p>Wait for input matching any of the given <code>pattern</code>s from any of the
specified sessions. Input is ignored until an input line matches one of
the given patterns; at this point status zero is returned, the matching
line is stored in $TCP_LINE, and the full set of lines read during the
call to tcp_expect is stored in the array $tcp_expect_lines.</p>
<p>Sessions are specified in the same way as tcp_read: the default is to
use the current session, otherwise the sessions specified by -a, -s, or
-l are used.</p>
<p>Each <code>pattern</code> is a standard zsh extended-globbing pattern; note that it
needs to be quoted to avoid it being expanded immediately by filename
generation. It must match the full line, so to match a substring there
must be a ‘*’ at the start and end. The line matched against includes
the $TCP_PROMPT added by tcp_read. It is possible to include the
globbing flags ‘#b’ or ‘#m’ in the patterns to make backreferences
available in the parameters $MATCH, $match, etc., as described in the
base zsh documentation on pattern matching.</p>
<p>Unlike tcp_read, the default behaviour of tcp_expect is to block
indefinitely until the required input is found. This can be modified by
specifying a timeout with -t or -T; these function as in tcp_read,
specifying a per-read or overall timeout, respectively, in seconds, as
an integer or floating-point number. As tcp_read, the function returns
status 2 if a timeout occurs.</p>
<p>The function returns as soon as any one of the patterns given match. If
the caller needs to know which of the patterns matched, the option -p
<code>var</code> can be used; on return, $var is set to the number of the pattern
using ordinary zsh indexing, i.e. the first is 1, and so on. Note the
absence of a ‘$’ in front of <code>var</code>. To avoid clashes, the parameter
cannot begin with ‘_expect’. The index -1 is used if there is a timeout
and 0 if there is no match.</p>
<p>The option -P <code>var</code> works similarly to -p, but instead of numerical
indexes the regular arguments must begin with a prefix followed by a
colon: that prefix is then used as a tag to which <code>var</code> is set when the
argument matches. The tag timeout is used if there is a timeout and the
empty string if there is no match. Note it is matches do not need to be
distinguished.</p>
<p>The option -q is passed directly down to tcp_read.</p>
<p>As all input is done via tcp_read, all the usual rules about output of
lines read apply. One exception is that the parameter $tcp_lines will
only reflect the line actually matched by tcp_expect; use
$tcp_expect_lines for the full set of lines read during the function
call.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fproxy"></span></p>
<p>tcp_proxy</p>
<p>This is a simple-minded function to accept a TCP connection and execute
a command with I/O redirected to the connection. Extreme caution should
be taken as there is no security whatsoever and this can leave your
computer open to the world. Ideally, it should only be used behind a
firewall.</p>
<p>The first argument is a TCP port on which the function will listen.</p>
<p>The remaining arguments give a command and its arguments to execute with
standard input, standard output and standard error redirected to the
file descriptor on which the TCP session has been accepted. If no
command is given, a new zsh is started. This gives everyone on your
network direct access to your account, which in many cases will be a bad
thing.</p>
<p>The command is run in the background, so tcp_proxy can then accept new
connections. It continues to accept new connections until interrupted.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fspam"></span></p>
<p>tcp_spam [ -ertv ] [ -a | -s <code>sess</code> | -l <code>sess</code>[,...] ] <code>cmd</code> [
<code>arg</code> ... ]</p>
<p>Execute ‘<code>cmd</code> [ <code>arg</code> ... ]’ for each session in turn. Note this
executes the command and arguments; it does not send the command line as
data unless the -t (transmit) option is given.</p>
<p>The sessions may be selected explicitly with the standard -a, -s or -l
options, or may be chosen implicitly. If none of the three options is
given the rules are: first, if the array $tcp_spam_list is set, this is
taken as the list of sessions, otherwise all sessions are taken. Second,
any sessions given in the array $tcp_no_spam_list are removed from the
list of sessions.</p>
<p>Normally, any sessions added by the ‘-a’ flag or when all sessions are
chosen implicitly are spammed in alphabetic order; sessions given by the
$tcp_spam_list array or on the command line are spammed in the order
given. The -r flag reverses the order however it was arrived it.</p>
<p>The -v flag specifies that a $TCP_PROMPT will be output before each
session. This is output after any modification to TCP_SESS by the
user-defined tcp_on_spam function described below. (Obviously that
function is able to generate its own output.)</p>
<p>If the option -e is present, the line given as ‘<code>cmd</code> [ <code>arg</code> ... ]’
is executed using eval, otherwise it is executed without any further
processing.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005ftalk"></span></p>
<p>tcp_talk</p>
<p>This is a fairly simple-minded attempt to force input to the line editor
to go straight to the default TCP_SESS.</p>
<p>An escape string, $TCP_TALK_ESCAPE, default ‘:’, is used to allow access
to normal shell operation. If it is on its own at the start of the line,
or followed only by whitespace, the line editor returns to normal
operation. Otherwise, the string and any following whitespace are
skipped and the remainder of the line executed as shell input without
any change of the line editor’s operating mode.</p>
<p>The current implementation is somewhat deficient in terms of use of the
command history. For this reason, many users will prefer to use some
form of alternative approach for sending data easily to the current
session. One simple approach is to alias some special character (such as
‘%’) to ‘tcp_command --’.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fwait"></span></p>
<p>tcp_wait</p>
<p>The sole argument is an integer or floating point number which gives the
seconds to delay. The shell will do nothing for that period except wait
for input on all TCP sessions by calling tcp_read -a. This is similar to
the interactive behaviour at the command prompt when zle handlers are
installed.</p>

<p>tcp_point <code>port</code><br />
tcp_shoot <code>host</code> <code>port</code><br />
This pair of functions provide a simple way to transfer a file between
two hosts within the shell. Note, however, that bulk data transfer is
currently done using cat. tcp_point reads any data arriving at <code>port</code>
and sends it to standard output; tcp_shoot connects to <code>port</code> on <code>host</code>
and sends its standard input. Any unused <code>port</code> may be used; the
standard mechanism for picking a port is to think of a random four-digit
number above 1024 until one works.</p>
<p>To transfer a file from host woodcock to host springes, on springes:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">tcp_point 8091 &gt;output_file
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>and on woodcock:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">tcp_shoot springes 8091 &lt;input_file
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>As these two functions do not require tcp_open to set up a TCP
connection first, they may need to be autoloaded separately.</p>

<h2 id="243-tcp-user-defined-functions"><a class="header" href="#243-tcp-user-defined-functions">24.3 TCP User-defined Functions</a></h2>
<p>Certain functions, if defined by the user, will be called by the
function system in certain contexts. This facility depends on the module
zsh/parameter, which is usually available in interactive shells as the
completion system depends on it. None of the functions need be defined;
they simply provide convenient hooks when necessary.</p>
<p>Typically, these are called after the requested action has been taken,
so that the various parameters will reflect the new state.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fon_005falias"></span></p>
<p>tcp_on_alias <code>alias</code> <code>fd</code></p>
<p>When an alias is defined, this function will be called with two
arguments: the name of the alias, and the file descriptor of the
corresponding session.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fon_005fawol"></span></p>
<p>tcp_on_awol <code>sess</code> <code>fd</code></p>
<p>If the function tcp_fd_handler is handling input from the line editor
and detects that the file descriptor is no longer reusable, by default
it removes it from the list of file descriptors handled by this method
and prints a message. If the function tcp_on_awol is defined it is
called immediately before this point. It may return status 100, which
indicates that the normal handling should still be performed; any other
return status indicates that no further action should be taken and the
tcp_fd_handler should return immediately with the given status.
Typically the action of tcp_on_awol will be to close the session.</p>
<p>The variable TCP_INVALIDATE_ZLE will be a non-empty string if it is
necessary to invalidate the line editor display using ‘zle -I’ before
printing output from the function.</p>
<p>(‘AWOL’ is military jargon for ‘absent without leave’ or some variation.
It has no pre-existing technical meaning known to the author.)</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fon_005fclose"></span></p>
<p>tcp_on_close <code>sess</code> <code>fd</code></p>
<p>This is called with the name of a session being closed and the file
descriptor which corresponded to that session. Both will be invalid by
the time the function is called.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fon_005fopen"></span></p>
<p>tcp_on_open <code>sess</code> <code>fd</code></p>
<p>This is called after a new session has been defined with the session
name and file descriptor as arguments. If it returns a non-zero status,
opening the session is assumed to fail and the session is closed again;
however, tcp_open will continue to attempt to open any remaining
sessions given on the command line.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fon_005frename"></span></p>
<p>tcp_on_rename <code>oldsess</code> <code>fd</code> <code>newsess</code></p>
<p>This is called after a session has been renamed with the three arguments
old session name, file descriptor, new session name.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fon_005fspam"></span></p>
<p>tcp_on_spam <code>sess</code> <code>command ...</code></p>
<p>This is called once for each session spammed, just <em>before</em> a command is
executed for a session by tcp_spam. The arguments are the session name
followed by the command list to be executed. If tcp_spam was called with
the option -t, the first command will be tcp_send.</p>
<p>This function is called after $TCP_SESS is set to reflect the session to
be spammed, but before any use of it is made. Hence it is possible to
alter the value of $TCP_SESS within this function. For example, the
session arguments to tcp_spam could include extra information to be
stripped off and processed in tcp_on_spam.</p>
<p>If the function sets the parameter $REPLY to ‘done’, the command line is
not executed; in addition, no prompt is printed for the -v option to
tcp_spam.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fon_005funalias"></span></p>
<p>tcp_on_unalias <code>alias</code> <code>fd</code></p>
<p>This is called with the name of an alias and the corresponding session’s
file descriptor after an alias has been deleted.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="TCP-Utility-Functions"></span></p>
<h2 id="244-tcp-utility-functions"><a class="header" href="#244-tcp-utility-functions">24.4 TCP Utility Functions</a></h2>
<p>The following functions are used by the TCP function system but will
rarely if ever need to be called directly.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005ffd_005fhandler"></span></p>
<p>tcp_fd_handler</p>
<p>This is the function installed by tcp_open for handling input from
within the line editor, if that is required. It is in the format
documented for the builtin ‘zle -F’ in <a href="Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Zle-Builtins">Zle
Builtins</a> .</p>
<p>While active, the function sets the parameter TCP_HANDLER_ACTIVE to 1.
This allows shell code called internally (for example, by setting
tcp_on_read) to tell if is being called when the shell is otherwise idle
at the editor prompt.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005foutput"></span></p>
<p>tcp_output [ -q ] -P <code>prompt</code> -F <code>fd</code> -S <code>sess</code></p>
<p>This function is used for both logging and handling output to standard
output, from within tcp_read and (if $TCP_OUTPUT is set) tcp_send.</p>
<p>The <code>prompt</code> to use is specified by -P; the default is the empty string.
It can contain:</p>
<p>%c<br />
Expands to 1 if the session is the current session, otherwise 0. Used
with ternary expressions such as ‘%(c.-.+)’ to output ‘+’ for the
current session and ‘-’ otherwise.</p>
<p>%f<br />
Replaced by the session’s file descriptor.</p>
<p>%s<br />
Replaced by the session name.</p>
<p>%%<br />
Replaced by a single ‘%’.</p>
<p>The option -q suppresses output to standard output, but not to any log
files which are configured.</p>
<p>The -S and -F options are used to pass in the session name and file
descriptor for possible replacement in the prompt.</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="245-tcp-user-parameters"><a class="header" href="#245-tcp-user-parameters">24.5 TCP User Parameters</a></h2>
<p>Parameters follow the usual convention that uppercase is used for
scalars and integers, while lowercase is used for normal and associative
array. It is always safe for user code to read these parameters. Some
parameters may also be set; these are noted explicitly. Others are
included in this group as they are set by the function system for the
user’s benefit, i.e. setting them is typically not useful but is benign.</p>
<p>For example, ‘local TCP_SILENT=1’ specifies that data read during the
function call will not be printed to standard output, regardless of the
setting outside the function. Likewise, ‘local TCP_SESS=<code>sess</code>’ sets a
session for the duration of a function, and ‘local TCP_PROMPT=’
specifies that no prompt is used for input during the function.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fexpect_005flines"></span></p>
<p>tcp_expect_lines</p>
<p>Array. The set of lines read during the last call to tcp_expect,
including the last ($TCP_LINE).</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005ffilter"></span></p>
<p>tcp_filter</p>
<p>Array. May be set directly. A set of extended globbing patterns which,
if matched in tcp_output, will cause the line not to be printed to
standard output. The patterns should be defined as described for the
arguments to tcp_expect. Output of line to log files is not affected.</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fHANDLER_005fACTIVE"></span></p>
<p>TCP_HANDLER_ACTIVE</p>
<p>Scalar. Set to 1 within tcp_fd_handler to indicate to functions called
recursively that they have been called during an editor session.
Otherwise unset.</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fLINE"></span></p>
<p>TCP_LINE</p>
<p>The last line read by tcp_read, and hence also tcp_expect.</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fLINE_005fFD"></span></p>
<p>TCP_LINE_FD</p>
<p>The file descriptor from which $TCP_LINE was read.
${tcp_by_fd[$TCP_LINE_FD]} will give the corresponding session name.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005flines"></span></p>
<p>tcp_lines</p>
<p>Array. The set of lines read during the last call to tcp_read, including
the last ($TCP_LINE).</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fLOG"></span></p>
<p>TCP_LOG</p>
<p>May be set directly, although it is also controlled by tcp_log. The name
of a file to which output from all sessions will be sent. The output is
proceeded by the usual $TCP_PROMPT. If it is not an absolute path name,
it will follow the user’s current directory.</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fLOG_005fSESS"></span></p>
<p>TCP_LOG_SESS</p>
<p>May be set directly, although it is also controlled by tcp_log. The
prefix for a set of files to which output from each session separately
will be sent; the full filename is ${TCP_LOG_SESS}.<code>sess</code>. Output to
each file is raw; no prompt is added. If it is not an absolute path
name, it will follow the user’s current directory.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fno_005fspam_005flist"></span></p>
<p>tcp_no_spam_list</p>
<p>Array. May be set directly. See tcp_spam for how this is used.</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fOUTPUT"></span></p>
<p>TCP_OUTPUT</p>
<p>May be set directly. If a non-empty string, any data sent to a session
by tcp_send will be logged. This parameter gives the prompt to be used
in a file specified by $TCP_LOG but not in a file generated from
$TCP_LOG_SESS. The prompt string has the same format as TCP_PROMPT and
the same rules for its use apply.</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fPROMPT"></span></p>
<p>TCP_PROMPT</p>
<p>May be set directly. Used as the prefix for data read by tcp_read which
is printed to standard output or to the log file given by $TCP_LOG, if
any. Any ‘%s’, ‘%f’ or ‘%%’ occurring in the string will be replaced by
the name of the session, the session’s underlying file descriptor, or a
single ‘%’, respectively. The expression ‘%c’ expands to 1 if the
session being read is the current session, else 0; this is most useful
in ternary expressions such as ‘%(c.-.+)’ which outputs ‘+’ if the
session is the current one, else ‘-’.</p>
<p>If the prompt starts with %P, this is stripped and the complete result
of the previous stage is passed through standard prompt %-style
formatting before being output.</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fREAD_005fDEBUG"></span></p>
<p>TCP_READ_DEBUG</p>
<p>May be set directly. If this has non-zero length, tcp_read will give
some limited diagnostics about data being read.</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fSECONDS_005fSTART"></span></p>
<p>TCP_SECONDS_START</p>
<p>This value is created and initialised to zero by tcp_open.</p>
<p>The functions tcp_read and tcp_expect use the shell’s SECONDS parameter
for their own timing purposes. If that parameter is not of floating
point type on entry to one of the functions, it will create a local
parameter SECONDS which is floating point and set the parameter
TCP_SECONDS_START to the previous value of $SECONDS. If the parameter is
already floating point, it is used without a local copy being created
and TCP_SECONDS_START is not set. As the global value is zero, the shell
elapsed time is guaranteed to be the sum of $SECONDS and
$TCP_SECONDS_START.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by setting SECONDS globally to a floating point
value using ‘typeset -F SECONDS’; then the TCP functions will never make
a local copy and never set TCP_SECONDS_START to a non-zero value.</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fSESS"></span></p>
<p>TCP_SESS</p>
<p>May be set directly. The current session; must refer to one of the
sessions established by tcp_open.</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fSILENT"></span></p>
<p>TCP_SILENT</p>
<p>May be set directly, although it is also controlled by tcp_log. If of
non-zero length, data read by tcp_read will not be written to standard
output, though may still be written to a log file.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fspam_005flist"></span></p>
<p>tcp_spam_list</p>
<p>Array. May be set directly. See the description of the function tcp_spam
for how this is used.</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fTALK_005fESCAPE"></span></p>
<p>TCP_TALK_ESCAPE</p>
<p>May be set directly. See the description of the function tcp_talk for
how this is used.</p>
<p><span id="index-TCP_005fTIMEOUT"></span></p>

<p>The following parameters are not set by the function system, but have a
special effect if set by the user.</p>
<p><span id="index-tcp_005fon_005fread"></span></p>
<p>tcp_on_read</p>
<p>This should be an associative array; if it is not, the behaviour is
undefined. Each key is the name of a shell function or other command,
and the corresponding value is a shell pattern (using EXTENDED_GLOB).
Every line read from a TCP session directly or indirectly using tcp_read
(which includes lines read by tcp_expect) is compared against the
pattern. If the line matches, the command given in the key is called
with two arguments: the name of the session from which the line was
read, and the line itself.</p>
<p>If any function called to handle a line returns a non-zero status, the
line is not output. Thus a tcp_on_read handler containing only the
instruction ‘return 1’ can be used to suppress output of particular
lines (see, however, tcp_filter above). However, the line is still
stored in TCP_LINE and tcp_lines; this occurs after all tcp_on_read
processing.</p>

<p>Here is a trivial example using a remote calculator.</p>

quite how infuriating the underlying command is):</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">tcp_proxy 7337 dc

<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">tcp_open localhost 7337 dc

<p>To send a command to the remote session and wait a short while for
output (assuming dc is the current session):</p>

<p>The tcp_proxy needs to be killed to be stopped. Note this will not
usually kill any connections which have already been accepted, and also
that the port is not immediately available for reuse.</p>

reads a complete line at once, data arriving without a terminating
newline can cause the function to block indefinitely.</p>
<p>Though the function suite works well for interactive use and for data
arriving in small amounts, the performance when large amounts of data
are being exchanged is likely to be extremely poor.</p>
