# The Z Shell Manual

This Info file documents Zsh, a freely available UNIX command
interpreter (shell), which of the standard shells most closely resembles
the Korn shell (ksh), although it is not completely compatible. Zsh is
able to emulate POSIX shells, but its default mode is not POSIX
compatible, either.
