# 2 Introduction

<span id="index-introduction"></span>

Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive login
shell and as a shell script command processor. Of the standard shells,
zsh most closely resembles ksh but includes many enhancements. It does
not provide compatibility with POSIX or other shells in its default
operating mode: see the section
[Compatibility](Invocation.html#Compatibility).

Zsh has command line editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable
command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history
mechanism, and a host of other features.

## 2.1 Author

<span id="index-author"></span>

Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad. Zsh is now maintained by the
members of the zsh-workers mailing list \<zsh-workers@zsh.org>. The
development is currently coordinated by Peter Stephenson \<pws@zsh.org>.
The coordinator can be contacted at \<coordinator@zsh.org>, but matters
relating to the code should generally go to the mailing list.

Zsh has a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), maintained by Peter
Stephenson \<pws@zsh.org>. It is regularly posted to the newsgroup
comp.unix.shell and the zsh-announce mailing list. The latest version

## 2.6 The Zsh Userguide

A userguide is currently in preparation. It is intended to complement
the manual, with explanations and hints on issues where the manual can
be cabbalistic, hierographic, or downright mystifying (for example, the
word ‘hierographic’ does not exist). It can be viewed in its current
state at <https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/>. At the time of writing,
chapters dealing with startup files and their contents and the new
completion system were essentially complete.
