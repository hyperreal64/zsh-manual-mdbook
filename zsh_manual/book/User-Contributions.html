<p>The Zsh source distribution includes a number of items contributed by
the user community. These are not inherently a part of the shell, and
some may not be available in every zsh installation. The most
significant of these are documented here. For documentation on other
contributed items such as shell functions, look for comments in the
function source files.</p>

<p><span id="index-helpfiles-utility"></span></p>
<p>The key sequence ESC h is normally bound by ZLE to execute the run-help
widget (see <a href="Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Zsh-Line-Editor">Zsh Line Editor</a>).
This invokes the run-help command with the command word from the current
input line as its argument. By default, run-help is an alias for the man
command, so this often fails when the command word is a shell builtin or
a user-defined function. By redefining the run-help alias, one can
improve the on-line help provided by the shell.</p>
<p>The helpfiles utility, found in the Util directory of the distribution,
is a Perl program that can be used to process the zsh manual to produce
a separate help file for each shell builtin and for many other shell
features as well. The autoloadable run-help function, found in
Functions/Misc, searches for these helpfiles and performs several other
tests to produce the most complete help possible for the command.</p>
<p>Help files are installed by default to a subdirectory of /usr/share/zsh
or /usr/local/share/zsh.</p>
<p>To create your own help files with helpfiles, choose or create a
directory where the individual command help files will reside. For
example, you might choose ~/zsh_help. If you unpacked the zsh
distribution in your home directory, you would use the commands:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">mkdir ~/zsh_help
perl ~/zsh-5.9/Util/helpfiles ~/zsh_help
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-HELPDIR"></span></p>
<p>The HELPDIR parameter tells run-help where to look for the help files.
When unset, it uses the default installation path. To use your own set
of help files, set this to the appropriate path in one of your startup
files:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">HELPDIR=~/zsh_help
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-run_002dhelp_002c-use-of"></span></p>
<p>To use the run-help function, you need to add lines something like the
following to your .zshrc or equivalent startup file:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">unalias run-help
autoload run-help
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note that in order for ‘autoload run-help’ to work, the run-help file
must be in one of the directories named in your fpath array (see
<a href="Parameters.html#Parameters-Used-By-The-Shell">Parameters Used By The
Shell</a>). This should
already be the case if you have a standard zsh installation; if it is
not, copy Functions/Misc/run-help to an appropriate directory.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Recompiling-Functions"></span></p>
<h3 id="2622-recompiling-functions"><a class="header" href="#2622-recompiling-functions">26.2.2 Recompiling Functions</a></h3>
<p><span id="index-functions_002c-recompiling"></span> <span
id="index-zrecompile-utility"></span></p>
<p>If you frequently edit your zsh functions, or periodically update your
zsh installation to track the latest developments, you may find that
function digests compiled with the zcompile builtin are frequently out
of date with respect to the function source files. This is not usually a
problem, because zsh always looks for the newest file when loading a
function, but it may cause slower shell startup and function loading.
Also, if a digest file is explicitly used as an element of fpath, zsh
won’t check whether any of its source files has changed.</p>
<p>The zrecompile autoloadable function, found in Functions/Misc, can be
used to keep function digests up to date.</p>
<p><span id="index-zrecompile"></span></p>
<p>zrecompile [ -qt ] [ <code>name</code> ... ]</p>
<p>zrecompile [ -qt ] -p <code>arg</code> ... [ -- <code>arg</code> ... ]</p>
<p>This tries to find *.zwc files and automatically re-compile them if at
least one of the original files is newer than the compiled file. This
works only if the names stored in the compiled files are full paths or
are relative to the directory that contains the .zwc file.</p>
<p>In the first form, each <code>name</code> is the name of a compiled file or a
directory containing *.zwc files that should be checked. If no
arguments are given, the directories and *.zwc files in fpath are used.</p>
<p>When -t is given, no compilation is performed, but a return status of
zero (true) is set if there are files that need to be re-compiled and
non-zero (false) otherwise. The -q option quiets the chatty output that
describes what zrecompile is doing.</p>
<p>Without the -t option, the return status is zero if all files that
needed re-compilation could be compiled and non-zero if compilation for
at least one of the files failed.</p>
<p>If the -p option is given, the <code>arg</code>s are interpreted as one or more
sets of arguments for zcompile, separated by ‘--’. For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zrecompile -p \ 
           -R ~/.zshrc -- \ 
           -M ~/.zcompdump -- \ 
           ~/zsh/comp.zwc ~/zsh/Completion/*/_*
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This compiles ~/.zshrc into ~/.zshrc.zwc if that doesn’t exist or if
it is older than ~/.zshrc. The compiled file will be marked for reading
instead of mapping. The same is done for ~/.zcompdump and
~/.zcompdump.zwc, but this compiled file is marked for mapping. The
last line re-creates the file ~/zsh/comp.zwc if any of the files
matching the given pattern is newer than it.</p>
<p>Without the -p option, zrecompile does not create function digests that
do not already exist, nor does it add new functions to the digest.</p>
<p>The following shell loop is an example of a method for creating function
digests for all functions in your fpath, assuming that you have write
permission to the directories:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">for ((i=1; i &lt;= $#fpath; ++i)); do
  dir=$fpath[i]
  zwc=${dir:t}.zwc
  if [[ $dir == (.|..) || $dir == (.|..)/* ]]; then
    continue
  fi
  files=($dir/*(N-.))
  if [[ -w $dir:h &amp;&amp; -n $files ]]; then
    files=(${${(M)files%/*/*}#/})

<p>The -U and -z options are appropriate for functions in the default zsh
installation fpath; you may need to use different options for your

them, you can keep them up to date by running zrecompile with no

<p><span id="index-keyboard-definition"></span> <span
id="index-zkbd"></span></p>
<p>The large number of possible combinations of keyboards, workstations,
terminals, emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to
have built-in key bindings for every situation. The zkbd utility, found
in Functions/Misc, can help you quickly create key bindings for your
configuration.</p>
<p>Run zkbd either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell script:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zsh -f ~/zsh-5.9/Functions/Misc/zkbd
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>When you run zkbd, it first asks you to enter your terminal type; if the
default it offers is correct, just press return. It then asks you to
press a number of different keys to determine characteristics of your
keyboard and terminal; zkbd warns you if it finds anything out of the
ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither ^H nor ^?.</p>
<p>The keystrokes read by zkbd are recorded as a definition for an
associative array named key, written to a file in the subdirectory .zkbd
within either your HOME or ZDOTDIR directory. The name of the file is
composed from the TERM, VENDOR and OSTYPE parameters, joined by hyphens.</p>
<p>You may read this file into your .zshrc or another startup file with the
‘source’ or ‘.’ commands, then reference the key parameter in bindkey
commands, like this:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">source ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zkbd/$TERM-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE
[[ -n ${key[Left]} ]] &amp;&amp; bindkey &quot;${key[Left]}&quot; backward-char
[[ -n ${key[Right]} ]] &amp;&amp; bindkey &quot;${key[Right]}&quot; forward-char
# etc.
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note that in order for ‘autoload zkbd’ to work, the zkdb file must be in
one of the directories named in your fpath array (see <a href="Parameters.html#Parameters-Used-By-The-Shell">Parameters Used
By The Shell</a>). This
should already be the case if you have a standard zsh installation; if
it is not, copy Functions/Misc/zkbd to an appropriate directory.</p>

<p><span id="index-reporter-utility"></span></p>
<p>Occasionally you may encounter what appears to be a bug in the shell,
particularly if you are using a beta version of zsh or a development
release. Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the problem
to one of the zsh mailing lists (see <a href="Introduction.html#Mailing-Lists">Mailing
Lists</a>), but sometimes one of the zsh
developers will need to recreate your environment in order to track the
problem down.</p>
<p>The script named reporter, found in the Util directory of the
distribution, is provided for this purpose. (It is also possible to
autoload reporter, but reporter is not installed in fpath by default.)
This script outputs a detailed dump of the shell state, in the form of
another script that can be read with ‘zsh -f’ to recreate that state.</p>
<p>To use reporter, read the script into your shell with the ‘.’ command
and redirect the output into a file:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">. ~/zsh-5.9/Util/reporter &gt; zsh.report
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You should check the zsh.report file for any sensitive information such
as passwords and delete them by hand before sending the script to the
developers. Also, as the output can be voluminous, it’s best to wait for
the developers to ask for this information before sending it.</p>
<p>You can also use reporter to dump only a subset of the shell state. This
is sometimes useful for creating startup files for the first time. Most
of the output from reporter is far more detailed than usually is
necessary for a startup file, but the aliases, options, and zstyles
states may be useful because they include only changes from the
defaults. The bindings state may be useful if you have created any of
your own keymaps, because reporter arranges to dump the keymap creation
commands as well as the bindings for every keymap.</p>
<p>As is usual with automated tools, if you create a startup file with
reporter, you should edit the results to remove unnecessary commands.
Note that if you’re using the new completion system, you should <em>not</em>
dump the functions state to your startup files with reporter; use the
compdump function instead (see <a href="Completion-System.html#Completion-System">Completion
System</a>).</p>
<p>reporter [ <code>state</code> ... ]<br />
<span id="index-reporter"></span></p>
<p>Print to standard output the indicated subset of the current shell
state. The <code>state</code> arguments may be one or more of:</p>
<p>all<br />
Output everything listed below.</p>
<p>aliases<br />
Output alias definitions.</p>
<p>bindings<br />
Output ZLE key maps and bindings.</p>
<p>completion<br />
Output old-style compctl commands. New completion is covered by
functions and zstyles.</p>
<p>functions<br />
Output autoloads and function definitions.</p>
<p>limits<br />
Output limit commands.</p>
<p>options<br />
Output setopt commands.</p>
<p>styles<br />
Same as zstyles.</p>
<p>variables<br />
Output shell parameter assignments, plus export commands for any
environment variables.</p>
<p>zstyles<br />
Output zstyle commands.</p>
<p>If the <code>state</code> is omitted, all is assumed.</p>
<p>With the exception of ‘all’, every <code>state</code> can be abbreviated by any
prefix, even a single letter; thus a is the same as aliases, z is the
same as zstyles, etc.</p>

<p>add-zsh-hook [ -L | -dD ] [ -Uzk ] <code>hook</code> <code>function</code></p>
<p>Several functions are special to the shell, as described in the section
Special Functions, <a href="Functions.html#Functions">Functions</a>, in that they
are automatically called at specific points during shell execution. Each
has an associated array consisting of names of functions to be called at
the same point; these are so-called ‘hook functions’. The shell function
add-zsh-hook provides a simple way of adding or removing functions from
the array.</p>
<p><code>hook</code> is one of chpwd, periodic, precmd, preexec, zshaddhistory,
zshexit, or zsh_directory_name, the special functions in question. Note
that zsh_directory_name is called in a different way from the other
functions, but may still be manipulated as a hook.</p>
<p><code>function</code> is name of an ordinary shell function. If no options are
given this will be added to the array of functions to be executed in the
given context. Functions are invoked in the order they were added.</p>
<p>If the option -L is given, the current values for the hook arrays are
listed with typeset.</p>
<p>If the option -d is given, the <code>function</code> is removed from the array of
functions to be executed.</p>
<p>If the option -D is given, the <code>function</code> is treated as a pattern and
any matching names of functions are removed from the array of functions
to be executed.</p>
<p>The options -U, -z and -k are passed as arguments to autoload for
<code>function</code>. For functions contributed with zsh, the options -Uz are
appropriate.</p>
<p><span id="index-add_002dzle_002dhook_002dwidget"></span></p>
<p>add-zle-hook-widget [ -L | -dD ] [ -Uzk ] <code>hook</code> <code>widgetname</code></p>
<p>Several widget names are special to the line editor, as described in the
section Special Widgets, <a href="Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Zle-Widgets">Zle
Widgets</a>, in that they are
automatically called at specific points during editing. Unlike function
hooks, these do not use a predefined array of other names to call at the
same point; the shell function add-zle-hook-widget maintains a similar
array and arranges for the special widget to invoke those additional
widgets.</p>
<p><code>hook</code> is one of isearch-exit, isearch-update, line-pre-redraw,
line-init, line-finish, history-line-set, or keymap-select,
corresponding to each of the special widgets zle-isearch-exit, etc. The
special widget names are also accepted as the <code>hook</code> argument.</p>
<p><code>widgetname</code> is the name of a ZLE widget. If no options are given this
is added to the array of widgets to be invoked in the given hook
context. Widgets are invoked in the order they were added, with</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zle widgetname -Nw -f &quot;nolast&quot; -- &quot;$@&quot;
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-WIDGET_002c-in-hooks"></span></p>
<p>Note that this means that the ‘WIDGET’ special parameter tracks the
<code>widgetname</code> when the widget function is called, rather than tracking
the name of the corresponding special hook widget.</p>
<p>If the option -d is given, the <code>widgetname</code> is removed from the array of
widgets to be executed.</p>
<p>If the option -D is given, the <code>widgetname</code> is treated as a pattern and
any matching names of widgets are removed from the array.</p>
<p>If <code>widgetname</code> does not name an existing widget when added to the
array, it is assumed that a shell function also named <code>widgetname</code> is
meant to provide the implementation of the widget. This name is
therefore marked for autoloading, and the options -U, -z and -k are
passed as arguments to autoload as with add-zsh-hook. The widget is also
created with ‘zle -N <code>widgetname</code>’ to cause the corresponding function
to be loaded the first time the hook is called.</p>
<p>The arrays of <code>widgetname</code> are currently maintained in zstyle contexts,
one for each <code>hook</code> context, with a style of ‘widgets’. If the -L option
is given, this set of styles is listed with ‘zstyle -L’. This
implementation may change, and the special widgets that refer to the
styles are created only if add-zle-hook-widget is called to add at least
one widget, so if this function is used for any hooks, then all hooks
should be managed only via this function.</p>

<h2 id="263-remembering-recent-directories"><a class="header" href="#263-remembering-recent-directories">26.3 Remembering Recent Directories</a></h2>
<p>The function cdr allows you to change the working directory to a
previous working directory from a list maintained automatically. It is
similar in concept to the directory stack controlled by the pushd, popd
and dirs builtins, but is more configurable, and as it stores all
entries in files it is maintained across sessions and (by default)
between terminal emulators in the current session. Duplicates are
automatically removed, so that the list reflects the single most recent
use of each directory.</p>
<p>Note that the pushd directory stack is not actually modified or used by
cdr unless you configure it to do so as described in the configuration
section below.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Installation-2"></span></p>
<h3 id="2631-installation"><a class="header" href="#2631-installation">26.3.1 Installation</a></h3>
<p>The system works by means of a hook function that is called every time
the directory changes. To install the system, autoload the required
functions and use the add-zsh-hook function described above:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">autoload -Uz chpwd_recent_dirs cdr add-zsh-hook
add-zsh-hook chpwd chpwd_recent_dirs
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now every time you change directly interactively, no matter which
command you use, the directory to which you change will be remembered in
most-recent-first order.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Use"></span></p>
<h3 id="2632-use"><a class="header" href="#2632-use">26.3.2 Use</a></h3>
<p>All direct user interaction is via the cdr function.</p>
<p>The argument to cdr is a number <code>N</code> corresponding to the <code>N</code>th most
recently changed-to directory. 1 is the immediately preceding directory;
the current directory is remembered but is not offered as a destination.
Note that if you have multiple windows open 1 may refer to a directory
changed to in another window; you can avoid this by having per-terminal
files for storing directory as described for the recent-dirs-file style
below.</p>
<p>If you set the recent-dirs-default style described below cdr will behave
the same as cd if given a non-numeric argument, or more than one
argument. The recent directory list is updated just the same however you
change directory.</p>
<p>If the argument is omitted, 1 is assumed. This is similar to pushd’s
behaviour of swapping the two most recent directories on the stack.</p>
<p>Completion for the argument to cdr is available if compinit has been
run; menu selection is recommended, using:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':completion:*:*:cdr:*:*' menu selection
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>to allow you to cycle through recent directories; the order is
preserved, so the first choice is the most recent directory before the
current one. The verbose style is also recommended to ensure the
directory is shown; this style is on by default so no action is required
unless you have changed it.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Options-2"></span></p>
<h3 id="2633-options"><a class="header" href="#2633-options">26.3.3 Options</a></h3>
<p>The behaviour of cdr may be modified by the following options.</p>
<p>-l<br />
lists the numbers and the corresponding directories in abbreviated form
(i.e. with ~ substitution reapplied), one per line. The directories
here are not quoted (this would only be an issue if a directory name
contained a newline). This is used by the completion system.</p>
<p>-r<br />
sets the variable reply to the current set of directories. Nothing is
printed and the directory is not changed.</p>
<p>-e<br />
allows you to edit the list of directories, one per line. The list can
be edited to any extent you like; no sanity checking is performed.
Completion is available. No quoting is necessary (except for newlines,
where I have in any case no sympathy); directories are in unabbreviated
form and contain an absolute path, i.e. they start with /. Usually the
first entry should be left as the current directory.</p>
<p>-p ’<code>pattern</code>’<br />
Prunes any items in the directory list that match the given extended
glob pattern; the pattern needs to be quoted from immediate expansion on
the command line. The pattern is matched against each completely
expanded file name in the list; the full string must match, so wildcards
at the end (e.g. ’*removeme*’) are needed to remove entries with a
given substring.</p>
<p>If output is to a terminal, then the function will print the new list
after pruning and prompt for confirmation by the user. This output and
confirmation step can be skipped by using -P instead of -p.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Configuration-1"></span></p>
<h3 id="2634-configuration"><a class="header" href="#2634-configuration">26.3.4 Configuration</a></h3>
<p>Configuration is by means of the styles mechanism that should be
familiar from completion; if not, see the description of the zstyle
command in <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fzutil-Module">The zsh/zutil
Module</a>. The context for
setting styles should be ’:chpwd:*’ in case the meaning of the context
is extended in future, for example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':chpwd:*' recent-dirs-max 0
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>sets the value of the recent-dirs-max style to 0. In practice the style
name is specific enough that a context of ’*’ should be fine.</p>
<p>An exception is recent-dirs-insert, which is used exclusively by the
completion system and so has the usual completion system context
(’:completion:*’ if nothing more specific is needed), though again ’*’
should be fine in practice.</p>
<p>recent-dirs-default<br />
If true, and the command is expecting a recent directory index, and
either there is more than one argument or the argument is not an
integer, then fall through to &quot;cd&quot;. This allows the lazy to use only one
command for directory changing. Completion recognises this, too; see
recent-dirs-insert for how to control completion when this option is in
use.</p>
<p>recent-dirs-file<br />
The file where the list of directories is saved. The default is
${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.chpwd-recent-dirs, i.e. this is in your home
directory unless you have set the variable ZDOTDIR to point somewhere
else. Directory names are saved in $’<code>...</code>’ quoted form, so each line in
the file can be supplied directly to the shell as an argument.</p>
<p>The value of this style may be an array. In this case, the first file in
the list will always be used for saving directories while any other
files are left untouched. When reading the recent directory list, if
there are fewer than the maximum number of entries in the first file,
the contents of later files in the array will be appended with
duplicates removed from the list shown. The contents of the two files
are not sorted together, i.e. all the entries in the first file are
shown first. The special value + can appear in the list to indicate the
default file should be read at that point. This allows effects like the
following:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':chpwd:*' recent-dirs-file \ 
~/.chpwd-recent-dirs-${TTY##*/} +
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Recent directories are read from a file numbered according to the
terminal. If there are insufficient entries the list is supplemented
from the default file.</p>
<p>It is possible to use zstyle -e to make the directory configurable at
run time:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle -e ':chpwd:*' recent-dirs-file pick-recent-dirs-file
pick-recent-dirs-file() {
  if [[ $PWD = ~/text/writing(|/*) ]]; then
    reply=(~/.chpwd-recent-dirs-writing)
  else
    reply=(+)
  fi
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In this example, if the current directory is ~/text/writing or a
directory under it, then use a special file for saving recent
directories, else use the default.</p>
<p>recent-dirs-insert<br />
Used by completion. If recent-dirs-default is true, then setting this to
true causes the actual directory, rather than its index, to be inserted
on the command line; this has the same effect as using the corresponding
index, but makes the history clearer and the line easier to edit. With
this setting, if part of an argument was already typed, normal directory
completion rather than recent directory completion is done; this is
because recent directory completion is expected to be done by cycling
through entries menu fashion.</p>
<p>If the value of the style is always, then only recent directories will
be completed; in that case, use the cd command when you want to complete
other directories.</p>
<p>If the value is fallback, recent directories will be tried first, then
normal directory completion is performed if recent directory completion
failed to find a match.</p>
<p>Finally, if the value is both then both sets of completions are
presented; the usual tag mechanism can be used to distinguish results,
with recent directories tagged as recent-dirs. Note that the recent
directories inserted are abbreviated with directory names where
appropriate.</p>
<p>recent-dirs-max<br />
The maximum number of directories to save to the file. If this is zero
or negative there is no maximum. The default is 20. Note this includes
the current directory, which isn’t offered, so the highest number of
directories you will be offered is one less than the maximum.</p>
<p>recent-dirs-prune<br />
This style is an array determining what directories should (or should
not) be added to the recent list. Elements of the array can include:</p>
<p>parent<br />
Prune parents (more accurately, ancestors) from the recent list. If
present, changing directly down by any number of directories causes the
current directory to be overwritten. For example, changing from ~pws to
~pws/some/other/dir causes ~pws not to be left on the recent directory
stack. This only applies to direct changes to descendant directories;
earlier directories on the list are not pruned. For example, changing
from ~pws/yet/another to ~pws/some/other/dir does not cause ~pws to
be pruned.</p>
<p>pattern:<code>pattern</code><br />
Gives a zsh pattern for directories that should not be added to the
recent list (if not already there). This element can be repeated to add
different patterns. For example, ’pattern:/tmp(|/*)’ stops /tmp or its
descendants from being added. The EXTENDED_GLOB option is always turned
on for these patterns.</p>
<p>recent-dirs-pushd<br />
If set to true, cdr will use pushd instead of cd to change the
directory, so the directory is saved on the directory stack. As the
directory stack is completely separate from the list of files saved by
the mechanism used in this file there is no obvious reason to do this.</p>

<h3 id="2636-details-of-directory-handling"><a class="header" href="#2636-details-of-directory-handling">26.3.6 Details of directory handling</a></h3>
<p>This section is for the curious or confused; most users will not need to
know this information.</p>
<p>Recent directories are saved to a file immediately and hence are
preserved across sessions. Note currently no file locking is applied:
the list is updated immediately on interactive commands and nowhere else
(unlike history), and it is assumed you are only going to change
directory in one window at once. This is not safe on shared accounts,
but in any case the system has limited utility when someone else is
changing to a different set of directories behind your back.</p>
<p>To make this a little safer, only directory changes instituted from the
command line, either directly or indirectly through shell function calls
(but not through subshells, evals, traps, completion functions and the
like) are saved. Shell functions should use cd -q or pushd -q to avoid
side effects if the change to the directory is to be invisible at the
command line. See the contents of the function chpwd_recent_dirs for
more details.</p>

<p>The dynamic directory naming system is described in the subsection
<em>Dynamic named directories</em> of <a href="Expansion.html#Filename-Expansion">Filename
Expansion</a>. In this, a reference to
~[<code>...</code>] is expanded by a function found by the hooks mechanism.</p>
<p>The contributed function zsh_directory_name_generic provides a system
allowing the user to refer to directories with only a limited amount of
new code. It supports all three of the standard interfaces for directory
naming: converting from a name to a directory, converting in the reverse
direction to find a short name, and completion of names.</p>
<p>The main feature of this function is a path-like syntax, combining
abbreviations at multiple levels separated by &quot;:&quot;. As an example,
~[g:p:s] might specify:</p>
<p>g<br />
The top level directory for your git area. This first component has to
match, or the function will return indicating another directory name
hook function should be tried.</p>
<p>p<br />
The name of a project within your git area.</p>
<p>s<br />
The source area within that project.</p>
<p>This allows you to collapse references to long hierarchies to a very
compact form, particularly if the hierarchies are similar across
different areas of the disk.</p>
<p>Name components may be completed: if a description is shown at the top
of the list of completions, it includes the path to which previous
components expand, while the description for an individual completion
shows the path segment it would add. No additional configuration is
needed for this as the completion system is aware of the dynamic
directory name mechanism.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Usage"></span></p>
<h3 id="2641-usage"><a class="header" href="#2641-usage">26.4.1 Usage</a></h3>
<p>To use the function, first define a wrapper function for your specific
case. We’ll assume it’s to be autoloaded. This can have any name but
we’ll refer to it as zdn_mywrapper. This wrapper function will define
various variables and then call this function with the same arguments
that the wrapper function gets. This configuration is described below.</p>
<p>Then arrange for the wrapper to be run as a zsh_directory_name hook:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">autoload -Uz add-zsh-hook zsh_directory_name_generic zdn_mywrapper
add-zsh-hook -U zsh_directory_name zdn_mywrapper
</code></pre>
</div>
<hr />
<p><span id="Configuration"></span></p>
<h3 id="2642-configuration"><a class="header" href="#2642-configuration">26.4.2 Configuration</a></h3>
<p>The wrapper function should define a local associative array zdn_top.
Alternatively, this can be set with a style called mapping. The context
for the style is :zdn:<code>wrapper-name</code> where <code>wrapper-name</code> is the
function calling zsh_directory_name_generic; for example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle :zdn:zdn_mywrapper: mapping zdn_mywrapper_top
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The keys in this associative array correspond to the first component of
the name. The values are matching directories. They may have an optional
suffix with a slash followed by a colon and the name of a variable in
the same format to give the next component. (The slash before the colon
is to disambiguate the case where a colon is needed in the path for a
drive. There is otherwise no syntax for escaping this, so path
components whose names start with a colon are not supported.) A special
component :default: specifies a variable in the form /:<code>var</code> (the path
section is ignored and so is usually empty) that will be used for the
next component if no variable is given for the path. Variables referred
to within zdn_top have the same format as zdn_top itself, but contain
relative paths.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">local -A zdn_top=(
  g   ~/git
  ga  ~/alternate/git
  gs  /scratch/$USER/git/:second2
  :default: /:second1
)
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This specifies the behaviour of a directory referred to as ~[g:...]
or ~[ga:...] or ~[gs:...]. Later path components are optional; in
that case ~[g] expands to ~/git, and so on. gs expands to
/scratch/$USER/git and uses the associative array second2 to match the
second component; g and ga use the associative array second1 to match
the second component.</p>
<p>When expanding a name to a directory, if the first component is not g or
ga or gs, it is not an error; the function simply returns 1 so that a
later hook function can be tried. However, matching the first component
commits the function, so if a later component does not match, an error
is printed (though this still does not stop later hooks from being
executed).</p>
<p>For components after the first, a relative path is expected, but note
that multiple levels may still appear. Here is an example of second1:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">local -A second1=(
  p   myproject
  s   somproject
  os  otherproject/subproject/:third
)
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The path as found from zdn_top is extended with the matching directory,
so ~[g:p] becomes ~/git/myproject. The slash between is added
automatically (it’s not possible to have a later component modify the
name of a directory already matched). Only os specifies a variable for a
third component, and there’s no :default:, so it’s an error to use a
name like ~[g:p:x] or ~[ga:s:y] because there’s nowhere to look up
the x or y.</p>
<p>The associative arrays need to be visible within this function; the
generic function therefore uses internal variable names beginning
_zdn_ in order to avoid clashes. Note that the variable reply needs to
be passed back to the shell, so should not be local in the calling
function.</p>
<p>The function does not test whether directories assembled by component
actually exist; this allows the system to work across automounted file
systems. The error from the command trying to use a non-existent
directory should be sufficient to indicate the problem.</p>

<p>Here is a full fictitious but usable autoloadable definition of the
example function defined by the code above. So ~[gs:p:s] expands to
/scratch/$USER/git/myscratchproject/top/srcdir (with $USER also
expanded).</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">local -A zdn_top=(
  g   ~/git
  ga  ~/alternate/git
  gs  /scratch/$USER/git/:second2
  :default: /:second1
)

local -A second1=(
  p   myproject
  s   somproject
  os  otherproject/subproject/:third
)

local -A second2=(
  p   myscratchproject
  s   somescratchproject
)

local -A third=(
  s   top/srcdir
  d   top/documentation
)

# autoload not needed if you did this at initialisation...
autoload -Uz zsh_directory_name_generic
zsh_directory_name_generic &quot;$@
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>It is also possible to use global associative arrays, suitably named,
and set the style for the context of your wrapper function to refer to
this. Then your set up code would contain the following:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">typeset -A zdn_mywrapper_top=(...)
# ... and so on for other associative arrays ...
zstyle ':zdn:zdn_mywrapper:' mapping zdn_mywrapper_top
autoload -Uz add-zsh-hook zsh_directory_name_generic zdn_mywrapper
add-zsh-hook -U zsh_directory_name zdn_mywrapper
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>and the function zdn_mywrapper would contain only the following:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zsh_directory_name_generic &quot;$@&quot;
</code></pre>

<p><span id="index-version-control-utility"></span></p>
<p>In a lot of cases, it is nice to automatically retrieve information from
version control systems (VCSs), such as subversion, CVS or git, to be
able to provide it to the user; possibly in the user’s prompt. So that
you can instantly tell which branch you are currently on, for example.</p>
<p>In order to do that, you may use the vcs_info function.</p>
<p>The following VCSs are supported, showing the abbreviated name by which
they are referred to within the system:</p>

<p>There is also support for the patch management system quilt

Support</a> below for details.</p>
<p>To load vcs_info:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">autoload -Uz vcs_info
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>It can be used in any existing prompt, because it does not require any
specific $psvar entries to be available.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="vcs_005finfo-Quickstart"></span> <span id="Quickstart"></span></p>
<h3 id="2651-quickstart"><a class="header" href="#2651-quickstart">26.5.1 Quickstart</a></h3>
<p>To get this feature working quickly (including colors), you can do the
following (assuming, you loaded vcs_info properly - see above):</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:*' actionformats \ 
    '%F{5}(%f%s%F{5})%F{3}-%F{5}[%F{2}%b%F{3}|%F{1}%a%F{5}]%f '
zstyle ':vcs_info:*' formats       \ 
    '%F{5}(%f%s%F{5})%F{3}-%F{5}[%F{2}%b%F{5}]%f '
zstyle ':vcs_info:(sv[nk]|bzr):*' branchformat '%b%F{1}:%F{3}%r'
precmd () { vcs_info }
PS1='%F{5}[%F{2}%n%F{5}] %F{3}%3~ ${vcs_info_msg_0_}%f%# '
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Obviously, the last two lines are there for demonstration. You need to
call vcs_info from your precmd function. Once that is done you need a
<em>single quoted</em> ’${vcs_info_msg_0_}’ in your prompt.</p>
<p>To be able to use ’${vcs_info_msg_0_}’ directly in your prompt like
this, you will need to have the PROMPT_SUBST option enabled.</p>
<p>Now call the vcs_info_printsys utility from the command line:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">% vcs_info_printsys
## list of supported version control backends:
## disabled systems are prefixed by a hash sign (#)
bzr
cdv
cvs
darcs
fossil
git
hg
mtn
p4
svk
svn
tla
## flavours (cannot be used in the enable or disable styles; they
## are enabled and disabled with their master [git-svn -&gt; git])
## they *can* be used in contexts: ':vcs_info:git-svn:*'.
git-p4
git-svn
hg-git
hg-hgsubversion
hg-hgsvn
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You may not want all of these because there is no point in running the
code to detect systems you do not use. So there is a way to disable some
backends altogether:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:*' disable bzr cdv darcs mtn svk tla
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You may also pick a few from that list and enable only those:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:*' enable git cvs svn
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If you rerun vcs_info_printsys after one of these commands, you will see
the backends listed in the disable style (or backends not in the enable
style - if you used that) marked as disabled by a hash sign. That means
the detection of these systems is skipped <em>completely</em>. No wasted time
there.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="vcs_005finfo-Configuration"></span> <span
id="Configuration-3"></span></p>
<h3 id="2652-configuration"><a class="header" href="#2652-configuration">26.5.2 Configuration</a></h3>
<p>The vcs_info feature can be configured via zstyle.</p>
<p>First, the context in which we are working:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">:vcs_info:vcs-string:user-context:repo-root-name
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><code>vcs-string</code><br />
is one of: git, git-svn, git-p4, hg, hg-git, hg-hgsubversion, hg-hgsvn,
darcs, bzr, cdv, mtn, svn, cvs, svk, tla, p4 or fossil. This is followed
by ‘.quilt-<code>quilt-mode</code>’ in Quilt mode (see <a href="#vcs_005finfo-Quilt-Support">Quilt
Support</a> for details) and by ‘+<code>hook-name</code>’
while hooks are active (see <a href="#vcs_005finfo-Hooks">Hooks in vcs_info</a> for
details).</p>
<p>Currently, hooks in quilt mode don’t add the ‘.quilt-<code>quilt-mode</code>’
information. This may change in the future.</p>
<p><code>user-context</code><br />
is a freely configurable string, assignable by the user as the first
argument to vcs_info (see its description below).</p>
<p><code>repo-root-name</code><br />
is the name of a repository in which you want a style to match. So, if
you want a setting specific to /usr/src/zsh, with that being a CVS
checkout, you can set <code>repo-root-name</code> to zsh to make it so.</p>
<p>There are three special values for <code>vcs-string</code>: The first is named
-init-, that is in effect as long as there was no decision what VCS
backend to use. The second is -preinit-; it is used <em>before</em> vcs_info is
run, when initializing the data exporting variables. The third special
value is formats and is used by the vcs_info_lastmsg for looking up its
styles.</p>
<p>The initial value of <code>repo-root-name</code> is -all- and it is replaced with
the actual name, as soon as it is known. Only use this part of the
context for defining the formats, actionformats or branchformat styles,
as it is guaranteed that <code>repo-root-name</code> is set up correctly for these
only. For all other styles, just use ’*’ instead.</p>
<p>There are two pre-defined values for <code>user-context</code>:</p>
<p>default<br />
the one used if none is specified</p>
<p>command<br />
used by vcs_info_lastmsg to lookup its styles</p>
<p>You can of course use ’:vcs_info:*’ to match all VCSs in all
user-contexts at once.</p>
<p>This is a description of all styles that are looked up.</p>
<p><span id="index-formats"></span></p>
<p>formats</p>
<p>A list of formats, used when actionformats is not used (which is most of
the time).</p>
<p><span id="index-actionformats"></span></p>
<p>actionformats</p>
<p>A list of formats, used if there is a special action going on in your
current repository; like an interactive rebase or a merge conflict.</p>
<p><span id="index-branchformat"></span></p>
<p>branchformat</p>
<p>Some backends replace %b in the formats and actionformats styles above,
not only by a branch name but also by a revision number. This style lets
you modify how that string should look.</p>
<p><span id="index-nvcsformats"></span></p>
<p>nvcsformats</p>
<p>These &quot;formats&quot; are set when we didn’t detect a version control system
for the current directory or vcs_info was disabled. This is useful if
you want vcs_info to completely take over the generation of your prompt.
You would do something like PS1=’${vcs_info_msg_0_}’ to accomplish
that.</p>
<p><span id="index-hgrevformat"></span></p>
<p>hgrevformat</p>
<p>hg uses both a hash and a revision number to reference a specific
changeset in a repository. With this style you can format the revision
string (see branchformat) to include either or both. It’s only useful
when get-revision is true. Note, the full 40-character revision id is
not available (except when using the use-simple option) because
executing hg more than once per prompt is too slow; you may customize
this behavior using hooks.</p>
<p><span id="index-max_002dexports"></span></p>
<p>max-exports</p>
<p>Defines the maximum number of vcs_info_msg_*_ variables vcs_info will
set.</p>
<p><span id="index-enable-1"></span></p>
<p>enable</p>
<p>A list of backends you want to use. Checked in the -init- context. If
this list contains an item called NONE no backend is used at all and
vcs_info will do nothing. If this list contains ALL, vcs_info will use
all known backends. Only with ALL in enable will the disable style have
any effect. ALL and NONE are case insensitive.</p>
<p><span id="index-disable-1"></span></p>
<p>disable</p>
<p>A list of VCSs you don’t want vcs_info to test for repositories (checked
in the -init- context, too). Only used if enable contains ALL.</p>
<p><span id="index-disable_002dpatterns"></span></p>
<p>disable-patterns</p>
<p>A list of patterns that are checked against $PWD. If a pattern matches,
vcs_info will be disabled. This style is checked in the
:vcs_info:-init-:*:-all- context.</p>
<p>Say, ~/.zsh is a directory under version control, in which you do not
want vcs_info to be active, do:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:*' disable-patterns &quot;${(b)HOME}/.zsh(|/*)&quot;
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-use_002dquilt"></span></p>
<p>use-quilt</p>
<p>If enabled, the quilt support code is active in ‘addon’ mode. See <a href="#vcs_005finfo-Quilt-Support">Quilt
Support</a> for details.</p>
<p><span id="index-quilt_002dstandalone"></span></p>
<p>quilt-standalone</p>
<p>If enabled, ‘standalone’ mode detection is attempted if no VCS is active
in a given directory. See <a href="#vcs_005finfo-Quilt-Support">Quilt Support</a>
for details.</p>
<p><span id="index-quilt_002dpatch_002ddir"></span></p>
<p>quilt-patch-dir</p>
<p>Overwrite the value of the $QUILT_PATCHES environment variable. See
<a href="#vcs_005finfo-Quilt-Support">Quilt Support</a> for details.</p>
<p><span id="index-quiltcommand"></span></p>
<p>quiltcommand</p>
<p>When quilt itself is called in quilt support, the value of this style is
used as the command name.</p>
<p><span id="index-check_002dfor_002dchanges"></span></p>
<p>check-for-changes</p>
<p>If enabled, this style causes the %c and %u format escapes to show when
the working directory has uncommitted changes. The strings displayed by
these escapes can be controlled via the stagedstr and unstagedstr
styles. The only backends that currently support this option are git,
hg, and bzr (the latter two only support unstaged).</p>
<p>For this style to be evaluated with the hg backend, the get-revision
style needs to be set and the use-simple style needs to be unset. The
latter is the default; the former is not.</p>
<p>With the bzr backend, <em>lightweight checkouts</em> only honor this style if
the use-server style is set.</p>
<p>Note, the actions taken if this style is enabled are potentially
expensive (read: they may be slow, depending on how big the current
repository is). Therefore, it is disabled by default.</p>
<p><span id="index-check_002dfor_002dstaged_002dchanges"></span></p>
<p>check-for-staged-changes</p>
<p>This style is like check-for-changes, but it never checks the worktree
files, only the metadata in the .${vcs} dir. Therefore, this style
initializes only the %c escape (with stagedstr) but not the %u escape.
This style is faster than check-for-changes.</p>
<p>In the git backend, this style checks for changes in the index. Other
backends do not currently implement this style.</p>
<p>This style is disabled by default.</p>
<p><span id="index-stagedstr"></span></p>
<p>stagedstr</p>
<p>This string will be used in the %c escape if there are staged changes in
the repository.</p>
<p><span id="index-unstagedstr"></span></p>
<p>unstagedstr</p>
<p>This string will be used in the %u escape if there are unstaged changes
in the repository.</p>
<p><span id="index-command-2"></span></p>
<p>command</p>
<p>This style causes vcs_info to use the supplied string as the command to
use as the VCS’s binary. Note, that setting this in ’:vcs_info:*’ is
not a good idea.</p>
<p>If the value of this style is empty (which is the default), the used
binary name is the name of the backend in use (e.g. svn is used in an
svn repository).</p>
<p>The repo-root-name part in the context is always the default -all- when
this style is looked up.</p>
<p>For example, this style can be used to use binaries from non-default
installation directories. Assume, git is installed in /usr/bin but your
sysadmin installed a newer version in /usr/local/bin. Instead of
changing the order of your $PATH parameter, you can do this:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*:-all-' command /usr/local/bin/git
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-use_002dserver"></span></p>
<p>use-server</p>
<p>This is used by the Perforce backend (p4) to decide if it should contact
the Perforce server to find out if a directory is managed by Perforce.
This is the only reliable way of doing this, but runs the risk of a
delay if the server name cannot be found. If the server (more
specifically, the <code>host</code>:<code>port</code> pair describing the server) cannot be
contacted, its name is put into the associative array
vcs_info_p4_dead_servers and is not contacted again during the session
until it is removed by hand. If you do not set this style, the p4
backend is only usable if you have set the environment variable P4CONFIG
to a file name and have corresponding files in the root directories of
each Perforce client. See comments in the function VCS_INFO_detect_p4
for more detail.</p>
<p>The Bazaar backend (bzr) uses this to permit contacting the server about
lightweight checkouts, see the check-for-changes style.</p>
<p><span id="index-use_002dsimple"></span></p>
<p>use-simple</p>
<p>If there are two different ways of gathering information, you can select
the simpler one by setting this style to true; the default is to use the
not-that-simple code, which is potentially a lot slower but might be
more accurate in all possible cases. This style is used by the bzr, hg,
and git backends. In the case of hg it will invoke the external hexdump
program to parse the binary dirstate cache file; this method will not
return the local revision number.</p>
<p><span id="index-get_002drevision"></span></p>
<p>get-revision</p>
<p>If set to true, vcs_info goes the extra mile to figure out the revision
of a repository’s work tree (currently for the git and hg backends,
where this kind of information is not always vital). For git, the hash
value of the currently checked out commit is available via the %i
expansion. With hg, the local revision number and the corresponding
global hash are available via %i.</p>
<p><span id="index-get_002dmq"></span></p>
<p>get-mq</p>
<p>If set to true, the hg backend will look for a Mercurial Queue (mq)
patch directory. Information will be available via the ‘%m’ replacement.</p>
<p><span id="index-get_002dbookmarks"></span></p>
<p>get-bookmarks</p>
<p>If set to true, the hg backend will try to get a list of current
bookmarks. They will be available via the ‘%m’ replacement.</p>
<p>The default is to generate a comma-separated list of all bookmark names
that refer to the currently checked out revision. If a bookmark is
active, its name is suffixed an asterisk and placed first in the list.</p>
<p><span id="index-use_002dprompt_002descapes"></span></p>
<p>use-prompt-escapes</p>
<p>Determines if we assume that the assembled string from vcs_info includes
prompt escapes. (Used by vcs_info_lastmsg.)</p>
<p><span id="index-debug"></span></p>
<p>debug</p>
<p>Enable debugging output to track possible problems. Currently this style
is only used by vcs_info’s hooks system.</p>
<p><span id="index-hooks"></span></p>
<p>hooks</p>
<p>A list style that defines hook-function names. See <a href="#vcs_005finfo-Hooks">Hooks in
vcs_info</a> below for details.</p>
<p><span id="index-patch_002dformat"></span> <span
id="index-nopatch_002dformat"></span></p>
<p>patch-format</p>
<p>nopatch-format</p>
<p>This pair of styles format the patch information used by the %m expando
in formats and actionformats for the git and hg backends. The value is
subject to certain %-expansions described below. The expanded value is
made available in the global backend_misc array as
${backend_misc[patches]} (also if a set-patch-format hook is used).</p>
<p><span id="index-get_002dunapplied"></span></p>
<p>get-unapplied</p>
<p>This boolean style controls whether a backend should attempt to gather a
list of unapplied patches (for example with Mercurial Queue patches).</p>
<p>Used by the quilt, hg, and git backends.</p>
<p>The default values for these styles in all contexts are:</p>

<p>%m<br />
A &quot;misc&quot; replacement. It is at the discretion of the backend to decide
what this replacement expands to.</p>
<p>The hg and git backends use this expando to display patch information.
hg sources patch information from the mq extensions; git from
in-progress rebase and cherry-pick operations and from the stgit
extension. The patch-format and nopatch-format styles control the
generated string. The former is used when at least one patch from the
patch queue has been applied, and the latter otherwise.</p>
<p>The hg backend displays bookmark information in this expando (in
addition to mq information). See the get-mq and get-bookmarks styles.
Both of these styles may be enabled at the same time. If both are
enabled, both resulting strings will be shown separated by a semicolon
(that cannot currently be customized).</p>
<p>The quilt ‘standalone’ backend sets this expando to the same value as
the %Q expando.</p>
<p>%Q<br />
Quilt series information. When quilt is used (either in ‘addon’ mode or
as a ‘standalone’ backend), this expando is set to the quilt series’
patch-format string. The set-patch-format hook and nopatch-format style
are honoured.</p>
<p>See <a href="#vcs_005finfo-Quilt-Support">Quilt Support</a> below for details.</p>
<p>In branchformat these replacements are done:</p>
<p>%b<br />
The branch name. For hg, the branch name can include a topic name.</p>
<p>%r<br />
The current revision number or the hgrevformat style for hg.</p>
<p>In hgrevformat these replacements are done:</p>
<p>%r<br />
The current local revision number.</p>
<p>%h<br />
The current global revision identifier.</p>
<p>In patch-format and nopatch-format these replacements are done:</p>
<p>%p<br />
The name of the top-most applied patch; may be overridden by the
applied-string hook.</p>
<p>%u<br />
The number of unapplied patches; may be overridden by the
unapplied-string hook.</p>
<p>%n<br />
The number of applied patches.</p>
<p>%c<br />
The number of unapplied patches.</p>
<p>%a<br />
The number of all patches (%a = %n + %c).</p>
<p>%g<br />
The names of active mq guards (hg backend).</p>
<p>%G<br />
The number of active mq guards (hg backend).</p>
<p>Not all VCS backends have to support all replacements. For nvcsformats
no replacements are performed at all, it is just a string.</p>

<p>If you want to use the %b (bold off) prompt expansion in formats, which
expands %b itself, use %%b. That will cause the vcs_info expansion to
replace %%b with %b, so that zsh’s prompt expansion mechanism can handle
it. Similarly, to hand down %b from branchformat, use %%%%b. Sorry for
this inconvenience, but it cannot be easily avoided. Luckily we do not
clash with a lot of prompt expansions and this only needs to be done for
those.</p>
<p>When one of the gen-applied-string, gen-unapplied-string, and
set-patch-format hooks is defined, applying %-escaping
(‘foo=${foo//’%’/%%}’) to the interpolated values for use in the prompt
is the responsibility of those hooks (jointly); when neither of those
hooks is defined, vcs_info handles escaping by itself. We regret this
coupling, but it was required for backwards compatibility.</p>

<h3 id="2654-quilt-support"><a class="header" href="#2654-quilt-support">26.5.4 Quilt Support</a></h3>
<p>Quilt is not a version control system, therefore this is not implemented
as a backend. It can help keeping track of a series of patches. People
use it to keep a set of changes they want to use on top of software
packages (which is tightly integrated into the package build process -
the Debian project does this for a large number of packages). Quilt can
also help individual developers keep track of their own patches on top
of real version control systems.</p>
<p>The vcs_info integration tries to support both ways of using quilt by
having two slightly different modes of operation: ‘addon’ mode and
‘standalone’ mode).</p>
<p>Quilt integration is off by default; to enable it, set the use-quilt
style, and add %Q to your formats or actionformats style:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:*' use-quilt true
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Styles looked up from the Quilt support code include
‘.quilt-<code>quilt-mode</code>’ in the <code>vcs-string</code> part of the context, where
<code>quilt-mode</code> is either addon or standalone. Example:
:vcs_info:git.quilt-addon:default:<code>repo-root-name</code>.</p>
<p>For ‘addon’ mode to become active vcs_info must have already detected a
real version control system controlling the directory. If that is the
case, a directory that holds quilt’s patches needs to be found. That
directory is configurable via the ‘QUILT_PATCHES’ environment variable.
If that variable exists its value is used, otherwise the value ‘patches’
is assumed. The value from $QUILT_PATCHES can be overwritten using the
‘quilt-patch-dir’ style. (Note: you can use vcs_info to keep the value
of $QUILT_PATCHES correct all the time via the post-quilt hook).</p>
<p>When the directory in question is found, quilt is assumed to be active.
To gather more information, vcs_info looks for a directory called ‘.pc’;
Quilt uses that directory to track its current state. If this directory
does not exist we know that quilt has not done anything to the working
directory (read: no patches have been applied yet).</p>
<p>If patches are applied, vcs_info will try to find out which. If you want
to know which patches of a series are not yet applied, you need to
activate the get-unapplied style in the appropriate context.</p>
<p>vcs_info allows for very detailed control over how the gathered
information is presented (see
<a href="#vcs_005finfo-Configuration">Configuration</a> and <a href="#vcs_005finfo-Hooks">Hooks in
vcs_info</a>), all of which are documented below. Note
there are a number of other patch tracking systems that work on top of a
certain version control system (like stgit for git, or mq for hg); the
configuration for systems like that are generally configured the same
way as the quilt support.</p>
<p>If the quilt support is working in ‘addon’ mode, the produced string is
available as a simple format replacement (%Q to be precise), which can
be used in formats and actionformats; see below for details).</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the support code is working in ‘standalone’ mode,
vcs_info will pretend as if quilt were an actual version control system.
That means that the version control system identifier (which otherwise
would be something like ‘svn’ or ‘cvs’) will be set to ‘-quilt-’. This
has implications on the used style context where this identifier is the
second element. vcs_info will have filled in a proper value for the
&quot;repository’s&quot; root directory and the string containing the information
about quilt’s state will be available as the ‘misc’ replacement (and %Q
for compatibility with ‘addon’ mode).</p>
<p>What is left to discuss is how ‘standalone’ mode is detected. The
detection itself is a series of searches for directories. You can have
this detection enabled all the time in every directory that is not
otherwise under version control. If you know there is only a limited set
of trees where you would like vcs_info to try and look for Quilt in
‘standalone’ mode to minimise the amount of searching on every call to
vcs_info, there are a number of ways to do that:</p>
<p>Essentially, ‘standalone’ mode detection is controlled by a style called
‘quilt-standalone’. It is a string style and its value can have
different effects. The simplest values are: ‘always’ to run detection
every time vcs_info is run, and ‘never’ to turn the detection off
entirely.</p>
<p>If the value of quilt-standalone is something else, it is interpreted
differently. If the value is the name of a scalar variable the value of
that variable is checked and that value is used in the same
‘always’/‘never’ way as described above.</p>
<p>If the value of quilt-standalone is an array, the elements of that array
are used as directory names under which you want the detection to be
active.</p>
<p>If quilt-standalone is an associative array, the keys are taken as
directory names under which you want the detection to be active, but
only if the corresponding value is the string ‘true’.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, if the value of quilt-standalone is the name of a
function, the function is called without arguments and the return value
decides whether detection should be active. A ‘0’ return value is true;
a non-zero return value is interpreted as false.</p>
<p>Note, if there is both a function and a variable by the name of
quilt-standalone, the function will take precedence.</p>

<p><span id="index-vcs_005finfo_005fhookdel"></span></p>
<p>vcs_info_hookdel</p>
<p>Remove hook-functions from a given hook. The hook needs to be given as

names to un-register from the hook. If ‘-a’ is used as the first
argument, all occurrences of the functions are unregistered. Otherwise
only the last occurrence is removed (if a function was registered to a
hook more than once). The ‘+vi-’ prefix needs to be left out here. See

<p><span id="index-vcs_005finfo_005flastmsg"></span></p>

<h3 id="2657-hooks-in-vcs_info"><a class="header" href="#2657-hooks-in-vcs_info">26.5.7 Hooks in vcs_info</a></h3>
<p>Hooks are places in vcs_info where you can run your own code. That code
can communicate with the code that called it and through that, change
the system’s behaviour.</p>
<p>For configuration, hooks change the style context:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">:vcs_info:vcs-string+hook-name:user-context:repo-root-name
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>To register functions to a hook, you need to list them in the hooks
style in the appropriate context.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:*+foo:*' hooks bar baz
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This registers functions to the hook ‘foo’ for all backends. In order to
avoid namespace problems, all registered function names are prepended by
a ‘+vi-’, so the actual functions called for the ‘foo’ hook are
‘+vi-bar’ and ‘+vi-baz’.</p>
<p>If you would like to register a function to a hook regardless of the
current context, you may use the vcs_info_hookadd function. To remove a
function that was added like that, the vcs_info_hookdel function can be
used.</p>
<p>If something seems weird, you can enable the ‘debug’ boolean style in
the proper context and the hook-calling code will print what it tried to
execute and whether the function in question existed.</p>
<p>When you register more than one function to a hook, all functions are
executed one after another until one function returns non-zero or until
all functions have been called. Context-sensitive hook functions are
executed before statically registered ones (the ones added by
vcs_info_hookadd).</p>
<p>You may pass data between functions via an associative array, user_data.
For example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">+vi-git-myfirsthook(){
    user_data[myval]=$myval
}
+vi-git-mysecondhook(){
    # do something with ${user_data[myval]}
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>There are a number of variables that are special in hook contexts:</p>
<p>ret<br />
The return value that the hooks system will return to the caller. The
default is an integer ‘zero’. If and how a changed ret value changes the
execution of the caller depends on the specific hook. See the hook
documentation below for details.</p>
<p>hook_com<br />
An associated array which is used for bidirectional communication from
the caller to hook functions. The used keys depend on the specific hook.</p>
<p>context<br />
The active context of the hook. Functions that wish to change this
variable should make it local scope first.</p>
<p>vcs<br />
The current VCS after it was detected. The same values as in the
enable/disable style are used. Available in all hooks except start-up.</p>
<p>Finally, the full list of currently available hooks:</p>
<p>start-up<br />
Called after starting vcs_info but before the VCS in this directory is
determined. It can be used to deactivate vcs_info temporarily if
necessary. When ret is set to 1, vcs_info aborts and does nothing; when
set to 2, vcs_info sets up everything as if no version control were
active and exits.</p>
<p>pre-get-data<br />
Same as start-up but after the VCS was detected.</p>
<p>gen-hg-bookmark-string<br />
Called in the Mercurial backend when a bookmark string is generated; the
get-revision and get-bookmarks styles must be true.</p>
<p>This hook gets the names of the Mercurial bookmarks that vcs_info
collected from ‘hg’.</p>
<p>If a bookmark is active, the key ${hook_com[hg-active-bookmark]} is
set to its name. The key is otherwise unset.</p>
<p>When setting ret to non-zero, the string in
${hook_com[hg-bookmark-string]} will be used in the %m escape in
formats and actionformats and will be available in the global
backend_misc array as ${backend_misc[bookmarks]}.</p>
<p>gen-applied-string<br />
Called in the git (with stgit or during rebase or merge), and hg (with
mq) backends and in quilt support when the applied-string is generated;
the use-quilt zstyle must be true for quilt (the mq and stgit backends
are active by default).</p>
<p>The arguments to this hook describe applied patches in the opposite
order, which means that the first argument is the top-most patch and so
forth.</p>
<p>When the patches’ log messages can be extracted, those are embedded
within each argument after a space, so each argument is of the form
‘<code>patch-name</code> <code>first line of the log message</code>’, where <code>patch-name</code>
contains no whitespace. The mq backend passes arguments of the form
‘<code>patch name</code>’, with possible embedded spaces, but without extracting
the patch’s log message.</p>
<p>When setting ret to non-zero, the string in
${hook_com[applied-string]} will be available as %p in the
patch-format and nopatch-format styles. This hook is, in concert with
set-patch-format, responsible for %-escaping that value for use in the
prompt. (See <a href="#vcs_005finfo-Oddities">Oddities</a>.)</p>
<p>The quilt backend passes to this hook the inputs
${hook_com[quilt-patches-dir]} and, if it has been determined,
${hook_com[quilt-pc-dir]}.</p>
<p>gen-unapplied-string<br />
Called in the git (with stgit or during rebase), and hg (with mq)
backend and in quilt support when the unapplied-string is generated; the
get-unapplied style must be true.</p>
<p>This hook gets the names of all unapplied patches which vcs_info in
order, which means that the first argument is the patch next-in-line to
be applied and so forth.</p>
<p>The format of each argument is as for gen-applied-string, above.</p>
<p>When setting ret to non-zero, the string in
${hook_com[unapplied-string]} will be available as %u in the
patch-format and nopatch-format styles. This hook is, in concert with
set-patch-format, responsible for %-escaping that value for use in the
prompt. (See <a href="#vcs_005finfo-Oddities">Oddities</a>.)</p>
<p>The quilt backend passes to this hook the inputs
${hook_com[quilt-patches-dir]} and, if it has been determined,
${hook_com[quilt-pc-dir]}.</p>
<p>gen-mqguards-string<br />
Called in the hg backend when guards-string is generated; the get-mq
style must be true (default).</p>
<p>This hook gets the names of any active mq guards.</p>
<p>When setting ret to non-zero, the string in ${hook_com[guards-string]}
will be used in the %g escape in the patch-format and nopatch-format
styles.</p>
<p>no-vcs<br />
This hooks is called when no version control system was detected.</p>
<p>The ‘hook_com’ parameter is not used.</p>
<p>post-backend<br />
Called as soon as the backend has finished collecting information.</p>
<p>The ‘hook_com’ keys available are as for the set-message hook.</p>
<p>post-quilt<br />
Called after the quilt support is done. The following information is
passed as arguments to the hook: 1. the quilt-support mode (‘addon’ or
‘standalone’); 2. the directory that contains the patch series; 3. the
directory that holds quilt’s status information (the ‘.pc’ directory) or
the string &quot;-nopc-&quot; if that directory wasn’t found.</p>
<p>The ‘hook_com’ parameter is not used.</p>
<p>set-branch-format<br />
Called before ‘branchformat’ is set. The only argument to the hook is
the format that is configured at this point.</p>
<p>The ‘hook_com’ keys considered are ‘branch’ and ‘revision’. They are set
to the values figured out so far by vcs_info and any change will be used
directly when the actual replacement is done.</p>
<p>If ret is set to non-zero, the string in ${hook_com[branch-replace]}
will be used unchanged as the ‘%b’ replacement in the variables set by
vcs_info.</p>
<p>set-hgrev-format<br />
Called before a ‘hgrevformat’ is set. The only argument to the hook is
the format that is configured at this point.</p>
<p>The ‘hook_com’ keys considered are ‘hash’ and ‘localrev’. They are set
to the values figured out so far by vcs_info and any change will be used
directly when the actual replacement is done.</p>
<p>If ret is set to non-zero, the string in ${hook_com[rev-replace]} will
be used unchanged as the ‘%i’ replacement in the variables set by
vcs_info.</p>
<p>pre-addon-quilt<br />
This hook is used when vcs_info’s quilt functionality is active in
&quot;addon&quot; mode (quilt used on top of a real version control system). It is
activated right before any quilt specific action is taken.</p>
<p>Setting the ‘ret’ variable in this hook to a non-zero value avoids any
quilt specific actions from being run at all.</p>
<p>set-patch-format<br />
This hook is used to control some of the possible expansions in
patch-format and nopatch-format styles with patch queue systems such as
quilt, mqueue and the like.</p>
<p>This hook is used in the git, hg and quilt backends.</p>
<p>The hook allows the control of the %p (${hook_com[applied]}) and %u
(${hook_com[unapplied]}) expansion in all backends that use the hook.
With the mercurial backend, the %g (${hook_com[guards]}) expansion is
controllable in addition to that.</p>
<p>If ret is set to non-zero, the string in ${hook_com[patch-replace]}
will be used unchanged instead of an expanded format from patch-format
or nopatch-format.</p>
<p>This hook is, in concert with the gen-applied-string or
gen-unapplied-string hooks if they are defined, responsible for
%-escaping the final patch-format value for use in the prompt. (See
<a href="#vcs_005finfo-Oddities">Oddities</a>.)</p>
<p>The quilt backend passes to this hook the inputs
${hook_com[quilt-patches-dir]} and, if it has been determined,
${hook_com[quilt-pc-dir]}.</p>
<p>set-message<br />
Called each time before a ‘vcs_info_msg_<code>N</code>_’ message is set. It takes
two arguments; the first being the ‘<code>N</code>’ in the message variable name,
the second is the currently configured formats or actionformats.</p>
<p>There are a number of ‘hook_com’ keys, that are used here: ‘action’,
‘branch’, ‘base’, ‘base-name’, ‘subdir’, ‘staged’, ‘unstaged’,
‘revision’, ‘misc’, ‘vcs’ and one ‘miscN’ entry for each
backend-specific data field (N starting at zero). They are set to the
values figured out so far by vcs_info and any change will be used
directly when the actual replacement is done.</p>
<p>Since this hook is triggered multiple times (once for each configured
formats or actionformats), each of the ‘hook_com’ keys mentioned above
(except for the miscN entries) has an ‘_orig’ counterpart, so even if
you changed a value to your liking you can still get the original value
in the next run. Changing the ‘_orig’ values is probably not a good
idea.</p>
<p>If ret is set to non-zero, the string in ${hook_com[message]} will be
used unchanged as the message by vcs_info.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds rather confusing, take a look at
<a href="#vcs_005finfo-Examples">Examples</a> and also in the
Misc/vcs_info-examples file in the Zsh source. They contain some
explanatory code.</p>

<h3 id="2658-examples"><a class="header" href="#2658-examples">26.5.8 Examples</a></h3>
<p>Don’t use vcs_info at all (even though it’s in your prompt):</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:*' enable NONE

</div>
<p>Disable the backends for bzr and svk:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:*' disable bzr svk

</div>
<p>Disable everything <em>but</em> bzr and svk:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:*' enable bzr svk

<p>Provide a special formats for git:</p>

zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' actionformats ' GIT ACTION! [%b|%a]'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>All %x expansion in all sorts of formats (formats, actionformats,
branchformat, you name it) are done using the ‘zformat’ builtin from the
‘zsh/zutil’ module. That means you can do everything with these %x items
what zformat supports. In particular, if you want something that is
really long to have a fixed width, like a hash in a mercurial
branchformat, you can do this: %12.12i. That’ll shrink the 40 character
hash to its 12 leading characters. The form is actually ‘%<code>min</code>.<code>max</code>x’.
More is possible. See <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fzutil-Module">The zsh/zutil
Module</a> for details.</p>
<p>Use the quicker bzr backend</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:bzr:*' use-simple true

<p>If you do use use-simple, please report if it does
‘the-right-thing[tm]’.</p>
<p>Display the revision number in yellow for bzr and svn:</p>

<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:(svn|bzr):*' \ 
       branchformat '%b%%F{yellow}:%r'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The doubled percent sign is explained in
<a href="#vcs_005finfo-Oddities">Oddities</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one can use the raw colour codes directly:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:(svn|bzr):*' \ 
       branchformat '%b%{'${fg[yellow]}'%}:%r'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Normally when a variable is interpolated into a format string, the
variable needs to be %-escaped. In this example we skipped that because
we assume the value of ${fg[yellow]} doesn’t contain any % signs.</p>
<p>Make sure you enclose the color codes in %{<code>...</code>%} if you want to use
the string provided by vcs_info in prompts.</p>
<p>Here is how to print the VCS information as a command (not in a prompt):</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">vcsi() { vcs_info interactive; vcs_info_lastmsg }
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This way, you can even define different formats for output via
vcs_info_lastmsg in the ’:vcs_info:*:interactive:*’ namespace.</p>
<p>Now as promised, some code that uses hooks: say, you’d like to replace
the string ‘svn’ by ‘subversion’ in vcs_info’s %s formats replacement.</p>
<p>First, we will tell vcs_info to call a function when populating the
message variables with the gathered information:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:*+set-message:*' hooks svn2subversion
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Nothing happens. Which is reasonable, since we didn’t define the actual
function yet. To see what the hooks subsystem is trying to do, enable
the ‘debug’ style:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:*+*:*' debug true
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>That should give you an idea what is going on. Specifically, the
function that we are looking for is ‘+vi-svn2subversion’. Note, the
‘+vi-’ prefix. So, everything is in order, just as documented. When you
are done checking out the debugging output, disable it again:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:*+*:*' debug false
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now, let’s define the function:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">function +vi-svn2subversion() {
    [[ ${hook_com[vcs_orig]} == svn ]] &amp;&amp; hook_com[vcs]=subversion
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Simple enough. And it could have even been simpler, if only we had
registered our function in a less generic context. If we do it only in
the ‘svn’ backend’s context, we don’t need to test which the active
backend is:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:svn+set-message:*' hooks svn2subversion
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">function +vi-svn2subversion() {
    hook_com[vcs]=subversion
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>And finally a little more elaborate example, that uses a hook to create
a customised bookmark string for the hg backend.</p>
<p>Again, we start off by registering a function:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':vcs_info:hg+gen-hg-bookmark-string:*' hooks hgbookmarks
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>And then we define the ‘+vi-hgbookmarks’ function:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">function +vi-hgbookmarks() {
    # The default is to connect all bookmark names by
    # commas. This mixes things up a little.
    # Imagine, there's one type of bookmarks that is
    # special to you. Say, because it's *your* work.
    # Those bookmarks look always like this: &quot;sh/*&quot;
    # (because your initials are sh, for example).
    # This makes the bookmarks string use only those
    # bookmarks. If there's more than one, it
    # concatenates them using commas.
    # The bookmarks returned by `hg' are available in
    # the function's positional parameters.
    local s=&quot;${(Mj:,:)@:#sh/*}&quot;
    # Now, the communication with the code that calls
    # the hook functions is done via the hook_com[]
    # hash. The key at which the `gen-hg-bookmark-string'
    # hook looks is `hg-bookmark-string'. So:
    hook_com[hg-bookmark-string]=$s
    # And to signal that we want to use the string we
    # just generated, set the special variable `ret' to
    # something other than the default zero:
    ret=1
    return 0
}
</code></pre>

<p>You should make sure all the functions from the Functions/Prompts
directory of the source distribution are available; they all begin with
the string ‘prompt_’ except for the special function ‘promptinit’. You
also need the ‘colors’ and ‘add-zsh-hook’ functions from Functions/Misc.
All these functions may already be installed on your system; if not, you
will need to find them and copy them. The directory should appear as one
of the elements of the fpath array (this should already be the case if
they were installed), and at least the function promptinit should be
autoloaded; it will autoload the rest. Finally, to initialize the use of
the system you need to call the promptinit function. The following code
in your .zshrc will arrange for this; assume the functions are stored in
the directory ~/myfns:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">fpath=(~/myfns $fpath)
autoload -U promptinit
promptinit

<p><span id="Theme-Selection"></span></p>
<h3 id="2662-theme-selection"><a class="header" href="#2662-theme-selection">26.6.2 Theme Selection</a></h3>
<p>Use the prompt command to select your preferred theme. This command may
be added to your .zshrc following the call to promptinit in order to
start zsh with a theme already selected.</p>
<p>prompt [ -c | -l ]<br />
prompt [ -p | -h ] [ <code>theme</code> ... ]<br />
prompt [ -s ] <code>theme</code> [ <code>arg</code> ... ]<br />
Set or examine the prompt theme. With no options and a <code>theme</code> argument,
the theme with that name is set as the current theme. The available
themes are determined at run time; use the -l option to see a list. The
special <code>theme</code> ‘random’ selects at random one of the available themes
and sets your prompt to that.</p>
<p>In some cases the <code>theme</code> may be modified by one or more arguments,
which should be given after the theme name. See the help for each theme
for descriptions of these arguments.</p>
<p>Options are:</p>
<p>-c<br />
Show the currently selected theme and its parameters, if any.</p>
<p>-l<br />
List all available prompt themes.</p>
<p>-p<br />
Preview the theme named by <code>theme</code>, or all themes if no <code>theme</code> is
given.</p>
<p>-h<br />
Show help for the theme named by <code>theme</code>, or for the prompt function if
no <code>theme</code> is given.</p>
<p>-s<br />
Set <code>theme</code> as the current theme and save state.</p>
<p>prompt_<code>theme</code>_setup<br />
Each available <code>theme</code> has a setup function which is called by the
prompt function to install that theme. This function may define other
functions as necessary to maintain the prompt, including functions used
to preview the prompt or provide help for its use. You should not
normally call a theme’s setup function directly.</p>

<p>prompt off<br />
The theme ‘off’ sets all the prompt variables to minimal values with no
special effects.</p>
<p>prompt default<br />
The theme ‘default’ sets all prompt variables to the same state as if an
interactive zsh was started with no initialization files.</p>
<p>prompt restore<br />
The special theme ‘restore’ erases all theme settings and sets prompt
variables to their state before the first time the ‘prompt’ function was
run, provided each theme has properly defined its cleanup (see below).</p>
<p>Note that you can undo ‘prompt off’ and ‘prompt default’ with ‘prompt
restore’, but a second restore does not undo the first.</p>

<p><span id="Writing-Themes"></span></p>
<h3 id="2664-writing-themes"><a class="header" href="#2664-writing-themes">26.6.4 Writing Themes</a></h3>
<p>The first step for adding your own theme is to choose a name for it, and
create a file ‘prompt_<code>name</code>_setup’ in a directory in your fpath, such
as ~/myfns in the example above. The file should at minimum contain
assignments for the prompt variables that your theme wishes to modify.
By convention, themes use PS1, PS2, RPS1, etc., rather than the longer
PROMPT and RPROMPT.</p>
<p>The file is autoloaded as a function in the current shell context, so it
may contain any necessary commands to customize your theme, including
defining additional functions. To make some complex tasks easier, your
setup function may also do any of the following:</p>
<p>Assign prompt_opts<br />
The array prompt_opts may be assigned any of &quot;bang&quot;, &quot;cr&quot;, &quot;percent&quot;,
&quot;sp&quot;, and/or &quot;subst&quot; as values. The corresponding setopts (promptbang,
etc.) are turned on, all other prompt-related options are turned off.
The prompt_opts array preserves setopts even beyond the scope of
localoptions, should your function need that.</p>
<p>Modify hooks<br />
Use of add-zsh-hook and add-zle-hook-widget is recommended (see the
Manipulating Hook Functions section above). All hooks that follow the
naming pattern prompt_<code>theme</code>_<code>hook</code> are automatically removed when
the prompt theme changes or is disabled.</p>
<p>Declare cleanup<br />
If your function makes any other changes that should be undone when the
theme is disabled, your setup function may call</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">prompt_cleanup command
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>where <code>command</code> should be suitably quoted. If your theme is ever
disabled or replaced by another, <code>command</code> is executed with eval. You
may declare more than one such cleanup hook.</p>
<p>Define preview<br />
Define or autoload a function prompt_<code>name</code>_preview to display a
simulated version of your prompt. A simple default previewer is defined
by promptinit for themes that do not define their own. This preview
function is called by ‘prompt -p’.</p>
<p>Provide help<br />
Define or autoload a function prompt_<code>name</code>_help to display
documentation or help text for your theme. This help function is called
by ‘prompt -h’.</p>

<p>bash-style word functions<br />
If you are looking for functions to implement moving over and editing

transpose-words-match, capitalize-word-match<br />

select-word-style, match-word-context, match-words-by-style<br />
The first eight ‘-match’ functions are drop-in replacements for the
builtin widgets without the suffix. By default they behave in a similar
way. However, by the use of styles and the function select-word-style,
the way words are matched can be altered. select-word-match is intended
to be used as a text object in vi mode but with custom word styles. For
comparison, the widgets described in <a href="Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Text-Objects">Text
Objects</a> use fixed definitions of
words, compatible with the vim editor.</p>
<p>The simplest way of configuring the functions is to use
select-word-style, which can either be called as a normal function with
the appropriate argument, or invoked as a user-defined widget that will
prompt for the first character of the word style to be used. The first
time it is invoked, the first eight -match functions will automatically
replace the builtin versions, so they do not need to be loaded
explicitly.</p>
<p>The word styles available are as follows. Only the first character is
examined.</p>
<p>bash<br />
Word characters are alphanumeric characters only.</p>
<p>normal<br />
As in normal shell operation: word characters are alphanumeric
characters plus any characters present in the string given by the
parameter $WORDCHARS.</p>
<p>shell<br />
Words are complete shell command arguments, possibly including complete
quoted strings, or any tokens special to the shell.</p>
<p>whitespace<br />
Words are any set of characters delimited by whitespace.</p>
<p>default<br />
Restore the default settings; this is usually the same as ‘normal’.</p>
<p>All but ‘default’ can be input as an upper case character, which has the
same effect but with subword matching turned on. In this case, words
with upper case characters are treated specially: each separate run of
upper case characters, or an upper case character followed by any number
of other characters, is considered a word. The style subword-range can
supply an alternative character range to the default ‘[:upper:]’; the
value of the style is treated as the contents of a ‘[<code>...</code>]’ pattern
(note that the outer brackets should not be supplied, only those
surrounding named ranges).</p>
<p>More control can be obtained using the zstyle command, as described in
<a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fzutil-Module">The zsh/zutil Module</a>. Each
style is looked up in the context :zle:<code>widget</code> where <code>widget</code> is the
name of the user-defined widget, not the name of the function
implementing it, so in the case of the definitions supplied by
select-word-style the appropriate contexts are :zle:forward-word, and so
on. The function select-word-style itself always defines styles for the
context ‘:zle:*’ which can be overridden by more specific (longer)
patterns as well as explicit contexts.</p>
<p>The style word-style specifies the rules to use. This may have the
following values.</p>
<p>normal<br />
Use the standard shell rules, i.e. alphanumerics and $WORDCHARS, unless
overridden by the styles word-chars or word-class.</p>
<p>specified<br />
Similar to normal, but <em>only</em> the specified characters, and not also
alphanumerics, are considered word characters.</p>
<p>unspecified<br />
The negation of specified. The given characters are those which will
<em>not</em> be considered part of a word.</p>
<p>shell<br />
Words are obtained by using the syntactic rules for generating shell
command arguments. In addition, special tokens which are never command
arguments such as ‘()’ are also treated as words.</p>
<p>whitespace<br />
Words are whitespace-delimited strings of characters.</p>
<p>The first three of those rules usually use $WORDCHARS, but the value in
the parameter can be overridden by the style word-chars, which works in
exactly the same way as $WORDCHARS. In addition, the style word-class
uses character class syntax to group characters and takes precedence
over word-chars if both are set. The word-class style does not include
the surrounding brackets of the character class; for example,
‘-:[:alnum:]’ is a valid word-class to include all alphanumerics plus
the characters ‘-’ and ‘:’. Be careful including ‘]’, ‘^’ and ‘-’ as
these are special inside character classes.</p>
<p>word-style may also have ‘-subword’ appended to its value to turn on
subword matching, as described above.</p>
<p>The style skip-chars is mostly useful for transpose-words and similar
functions. If set, it gives a count of characters starting at the cursor
position which will not be considered part of the word and are treated
as space, regardless of what they actually are. For example, if</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':zle:transpose-words' skip-chars 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>has been set, and transpose-words-match is called with the cursor on the
<code>X</code> of foo<code>X</code>bar, where <code>X</code> can be any character, then the resulting
expression is bar<code>X</code>foo.</p>
<p>Finer grained control can be obtained by setting the style word-context
to an array of pairs of entries. Each pair of entries consists of a
<code>pattern</code> and a <code>subcontext</code>. The shell argument the cursor is on is
matched against each <code>pattern</code> in turn until one matches; if it does,
the context is extended by a colon and the corresponding <code>subcontext</code>.
Note that the test is made against the original word on the line, with
no stripping of quotes. Special handling is done between words: the
current context is examined and if it contains the string between the
word is set to a single space; else if it is contains the string back,
the word before the cursor is considered, else the word after cursor is
considered. Some examples are given below.</p>
<p>The style skip-whitespace-first is only used with the forward-word
widget. If it is set to true, then forward-word skips any
non-word-characters, followed by any non-word-characters: this is
similar to the behaviour of other word-orientated widgets, and also that
used by other editors, however it differs from the standard zsh
behaviour. When using select-word-style the widget is set in the context
:zle:* to true if the word style is bash and false otherwise. It may be
overridden by setting it in the more specific context
:zle:forward-word*.</p>
<p>It is possible to create widgets with specific behaviour by defining a
new widget implemented by the appropriate generic function, then setting
a style for the context of the specific widget. For example, the
following defines a widget backward-kill-space-word using
backward-kill-word-match, the generic widget implementing
backward-kill-word behaviour, and ensures that the new widget always
implements space-delimited behaviour.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zle -N backward-kill-space-word backward-kill-word-match
zstyle :zle:backward-kill-space-word word-style space
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The widget backward-kill-space-word can now be bound to a key.</p>
<p>Here are some further examples of use of the styles, actually taken from
the simplified interface in select-word-style:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':zle:*' word-style standard
zstyle ':zle:*' word-chars ''
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Implements bash-style word handling for all widgets, i.e. only
alphanumerics are word characters; equivalent to setting the parameter
WORDCHARS empty for the given context.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">style ':zle:*kill*' word-style space
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Uses space-delimited words for widgets with the word ‘kill’ in the name.
Neither of the styles word-chars nor word-class is used in this case.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of use of the word-context style to extend the
context.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':zle:*' word-context \ 
       &quot;*/*&quot; filename &quot;[[:space:]]&quot; whitespace
zstyle ':zle:transpose-words:whitespace' word-style shell
zstyle ':zle:transpose-words:filename' word-style normal
zstyle ':zle:transpose-words:filename' word-chars ''
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This provides two different ways of using transpose-words depending on
whether the cursor is on whitespace between words or on a filename, here
any word containing a /. On whitespace, complete arguments as defined by
standard shell rules will be transposed. In a filename, only
alphanumerics will be transposed. Elsewhere, words will be transposed
using the default style for :zle:transpose-words.</p>
<p>The word matching and all the handling of zstyle settings is actually
implemented by the function match-words-by-style. This can be used to
create new user-defined widgets. The calling function should set the
local parameter curcontext to :zle:<code>widget</code>, create the local parameter
matched_words and call match-words-by-style with no arguments. On
return, matched_words will be set to an array with the elements: (1) the
start of the line (2) the word before the cursor (3) any non-word
characters between that word and the cursor (4) any non-word character
at the cursor position plus any remaining non-word characters before the
next word, including all characters specified by the skip-chars
style, (5) the word at or following the cursor (6) any non-word
characters following that word (7) the remainder of the line. Any of the
elements may be an empty string; the calling function should test for
this to decide whether it can perform its function.</p>
<p>If the variable matched_words is defined by the caller to
match-words-by-style as an associative array (local -A matched_words),
then the seven values given above should be retrieved from it as
elements named start, word-before-cursor, ws-before-cursor,
ws-after-cursor, word-after-cursor, ws-after-word, and end. In addition
the element is-word-start is 1 if the cursor is on the start of a word
or subword, or on white space before it (the cases can be distinguished
by testing the ws-after-cursor element) and 0 otherwise. This form is
recommended for future compatibility.</p>
<p>It is possible to pass options with arguments to match-words-by-style to
override the use of styles. The options are:</p>
<p>-w<br />
<code>word-style</code></p>
<p>-s<br />
<code>skip-chars</code></p>
<p>-c<br />
<code>word-class</code></p>
<p>-C<br />
<code>word-chars</code></p>
<p>-r<br />
<code>subword-range</code></p>
<p>For example, match-words-by-style -w shell -c 0 may be used to extract
the command argument around the cursor.</p>
<p>The word-context style is implemented by the function
match-word-context. This should not usually need to be called directly.</p>
<p><span id="index-bracketed_002dpaste_002dmagic"></span></p>
<p>bracketed-paste-magic<br />
The bracketed-paste widget (see
<a href="Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a> in <a href="Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Standard-Widgets">Standard
Widgets</a>) inserts pasted text
literally into the editor buffer rather than interpret it as keystrokes.
This disables some common usages where the self-insert widget is
replaced in order to accomplish some extra processing. An example is the
contributed url-quote-magic widget described below.</p>
<p>The bracketed-paste-magic widget is meant to replace bracketed-paste
with a wrapper that re-enables these self-insert actions, and other
actions as selected by zstyles. Therefore this widget is installed with</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">autoload -Uz bracketed-paste-magic
zle -N bracketed-paste bracketed-paste-magic
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Other than enabling some widget processing, bracketed-paste-magic
attempts to replicate bracketed-paste as faithfully as possible.</p>
<p>The following zstyles may be set to control processing of pasted text.
All are looked up in the context ‘:bracketed-paste-magic’.</p>
<p>active-widgets<br />
A list of patterns matching widget names that should be activated during
the paste. All other key sequences are processed as self-insert-unmeta.
The default is ‘self-*’ so any user-defined widgets named with that
prefix are active along with the builtin self-insert.</p>
<p>If this style is not set (explicitly deleted) or set to an empty value,
no widgets are active and the pasted text is inserted literally. If the
value includes ‘undefined-key’, any unknown sequences are discarded from
the pasted text.</p>
<p>inactive-keys<br />
The inverse of active-widgets, a list of key sequences that always use
self-insert-unmeta even when bound to an active widget. Note that this
is a list of literal key sequences, not patterns.</p>
<p>paste-init<br />
A list of function names, called in widget context (but not as widgets).
The functions are called in order until one of them returns a non-zero
status. The parameter ‘PASTED’ contains the initial state of the pasted
text. All other ZLE parameters such as ‘BUFFER’ have their normal values
and side-effects, and full history is available, so for example
paste-init functions may move words from BUFFER into PASTED to make
those words visible to the active-widgets.</p>
<p>A non-zero return from a paste-init function does <em>not</em> prevent the
paste itself from proceeding.</p>
<p>Loading bracketed-paste-magic defines backward-extend-paste, a helper
function for use in paste-init.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic paste-init \ 
       backward-extend-paste
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>When a paste would insert into the middle of a word or append text to a
word already on the line, backward-extend-paste moves the prefix from
LBUFFER into PASTED so that the active-widgets see the full word so far.
This may be useful with url-quote-magic.</p>
<p>paste-finish<br />
Another list of function names called in order until one returns
non-zero. These functions are called <em>after</em> the pasted text has been
processed by the active-widgets, but <em>before</em> it is inserted into
‘BUFFER’. ZLE parameters have their normal values and side-effects.</p>
<p>A non-zero return from a paste-finish function does <em>not</em> prevent the
paste itself from proceeding.</p>
<p>Loading bracketed-paste-magic also defines quote-paste, a helper
function for use in paste-finish.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic paste-finish \ 
       quote-paste
zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic:finish quote-style \ 
       qqq
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>When the pasted text is inserted into BUFFER, it is quoted per the
quote-style value. To forcibly turn off the built-in numeric prefix
quoting of bracketed-paste, use:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic:finish quote-style \ 
       none
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><em>Important:</em> During active-widgets processing of the paste (after
paste-init and before paste-finish), BUFFER starts empty and history is
restricted, so cursor motions, etc., may not pass outside of the pasted
content. Text assigned to BUFFER by the active widgets is copied back
into PASTED before paste-finish.</p>
<p><span id="index-copy_002dearlier_002dword"></span></p>
<p>copy-earlier-word<br />
This widget works like a combination of insert-last-word and
copy-prev-shell-word. Repeated invocations of the widget retrieve
earlier words on the relevant history line. With a numeric argument <code>N</code>,
insert the <code>N</code>th word from the history line; <code>N</code> may be negative to
count from the end of the line.</p>
<p>If insert-last-word has been used to retrieve the last word on a
previous history line, repeated invocations will replace that word with
earlier words from the same line.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the widget applies to words on the line currently being
edited. The widget style can be set to the name of another widget that
should be called to retrieve words. This widget must accept the same
three arguments as insert-last-word.</p>
<p><span id="index-cycle_002dcompletion_002dpositions"></span></p>
<p>cycle-completion-positions<br />
After inserting an unambiguous string into the command line, the new
function based completion system may know about multiple places in this
string where characters are missing or differ from at least one of the
possible matches. It will then place the cursor on the position it
considers to be the most interesting one, i.e. the one where one can
disambiguate between as many matches as possible with as little typing
as possible.</p>
<p>This widget allows the cursor to be easily moved to the other
interesting spots. It can be invoked repeatedly to cycle between all
positions reported by the completion system.</p>
<p><span id="index-delete_002dwhole_002dword_002dmatch-1"></span></p>
<p>delete-whole-word-match<br />
This is another function which works like the -match functions described
immediately above, i.e. using styles to decide the word boundaries.
However, it is not a replacement for any existing function.</p>
<p>The basic behaviour is to delete the word around the cursor. There is no
numeric argument handling; only the single word around the cursor is
considered. If the widget contains the string kill, the removed text
will be placed in the cutbuffer for future yanking. This can be obtained
by defining kill-whole-word-match as follows:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zle -N kill-whole-word-match delete-whole-word-match
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>and then binding the widget kill-whole-word-match.</p>
<p><span id="index-down_002dline_002dor_002dbeginning_002dsearch"></span>
<span id="index-up_002dline_002dor_002dbeginning_002dsearch"></span></p>
<p>up-line-or-beginning-search, down-line-or-beginning-search<br />
These widgets are similar to the builtin functions up-line-or-search and
down-line-or-search: if in a multiline buffer they move up or down
within the buffer, otherwise they search for a history line matching the
start of the current line. In this case, however, they search for a line
which matches the current line up to the current cursor position, in the
manner of history-beginning-search-backward and -forward, rather than
the first word on the line.</p>
<p><span id="index-edit_002dcommand_002dline"></span></p>
<p>edit-command-line<br />
Edit the command line using your visual editor, as in ksh.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">bindkey -M vicmd v edit-command-line
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The editor to be used can also be specified using the editor style in
the context of the widget. It is specified as an array of command and
arguments:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle :zle:edit-command-line editor gvim -f
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-expand_002dabsolute_002dpath"></span></p>
<p>expand-absolute-path<br />
Expand the file name under the cursor to an absolute path, resolving
symbolic links. Where possible, the initial path segment is turned into
a named directory or reference to a user’s home directory.</p>
<p><span
id="index-history_002dbeginning_002dsearch_002dbackward_002dend"></span>
<span
id="index-history_002dbeginning_002dsearch_002dforward_002dend"></span></p>
<p>history-search-end<br />
This function implements the widgets
history-beginning-search-backward-end and
history-beginning-search-forward-end. These commands work by first
calling the corresponding builtin widget (see <a href="Zsh-Line-Editor.html#History-Control">History
Control</a>) and then moving the
cursor to the end of the line. The original cursor position is
remembered and restored before calling the builtin widget a second time,
so that the same search is repeated to look farther through the history.</p>
<p>Although you autoload only one function, the commands to use it are
slightly different because it implements two widgets.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zle -N history-beginning-search-backward-end \ 
       history-search-end
zle -N history-beginning-search-forward-end \ 
       history-search-end
bindkey '\e^P' history-beginning-search-backward-end
bindkey '\e^N' history-beginning-search-forward-end
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-history_002dbeginning_002dsearch_002dmenu"></span></p>
<p>history-beginning-search-menu<br />
This function implements yet another form of history searching. The text
before the cursor is used to select lines from the history, as for
history-beginning-search-backward except that all matches are shown in a
numbered menu. Typing the appropriate digits inserts the full history
line. Note that leading zeroes must be typed (they are only shown when
necessary for removing ambiguity). The entire history is searched; there
is no distinction between forwards and backwards.</p>
<p>With a numeric argument, the search is not anchored to the start of the
line; the string typed by the use may appear anywhere in the line in the
history.</p>
<p>If the widget name contains ‘-end’ the cursor is moved to the end of the
line inserted. If the widget name contains ‘-space’ any space in the
text typed is treated as a wildcard and can match anything (hence a
leading space is equivalent to giving a numeric argument). Both forms
can be combined, for example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zle -N history-beginning-search-menu-space-end \ 
       history-beginning-search-menu
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-history_002dpattern_002dsearch"></span> <span
id="index-history_002dpattern_002dsearch_002dbackward"></span> <span
id="index-history_002dpattern_002dsearch_002dforward"></span></p>
<p>history-pattern-search<br />
The function history-pattern-search implements widgets which prompt for
a pattern with which to search the history backwards or forwards. The
pattern is in the usual zsh format, however the first character may be ^
to anchor the search to the start of the line, and the last character
may be $ to anchor the search to the end of the line. If the search was
not anchored to the end of the line the cursor is positioned just after
the pattern found.</p>
<p>The commands to create bindable widgets are similar to those in the
example immediately above:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">autoload -U history-pattern-search
zle -N history-pattern-search-backward history-pattern-search
zle -N history-pattern-search-forward history-pattern-search
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-incarg"></span> <span
id="index-incarg_002c-use-of"></span></p>
<p>incarg<br />
Typing the keystrokes for this widget with the cursor placed on or to
the left of an integer causes that integer to be incremented by one.
With a numeric argument, the number is incremented by the amount of the
argument (decremented if the numeric argument is negative). The shell
parameter incarg may be set to change the default increment to something
other than one.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">bindkey '^X+' incarg
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-incremental_002dcomplete_002dword"></span></p>
<p>incremental-complete-word<br />
This allows incremental completion of a word. After starting this
command, a list of completion choices can be shown after every character
you type, which you can delete with ^H or DEL. Pressing return accepts
the completion so far and returns you to normal editing (that is, the
command line is <em>not</em> immediately executed). You can hit TAB to do
normal completion, ^G to abort back to the state when you started, and
^D to list the matches.</p>
<p>This works only with the new function based completion system.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">bindkey '^Xi' incremental-complete-word
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-insert_002dcomposed_002dchar"></span></p>
<p>insert-composed-char<br />
This function allows you to compose characters that don’t appear on the
keyboard to be inserted into the command line. The command is followed
by two keys corresponding to ASCII characters (there is no prompt). For
accented characters, the two keys are a base character followed by a
code for the accent, while for other special characters the two
characters together form a mnemonic for the character to be inserted.
The two-character codes are a subset of those given by RFC 1345 (see for
example <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345.html</a>).</p>
<p>The function may optionally be followed by up to two characters which
replace one or both of the characters read from the keyboard; if both
characters are supplied, no input is read. For example,
insert-composed-char a: can be used within a widget to insert an a with
umlaut into the command line. This has the advantages over use of a</p>
<p>For best results zsh should have been built with support for multibyte
characters (configured with –enable-multibyte); however, the function
works for the limited range of characters available in single-byte
character sets such as ISO-8859-1.</p>
<p>The character is converted into the local representation and inserted
into the command line at the cursor position. (The conversion is done
within the shell, using whatever facilities the C library provides.)
With a numeric argument, the character and its code are previewed in the
status line</p>
<p>The function may be run outside zle in which case it prints the
character (together with a newline) to standard output. Input is still
read from keystrokes.</p>
<p>See insert-unicode-char for an alternative way of inserting Unicode
characters using their hexadecimal character number.</p>
<p>The set of accented characters is reasonably complete up to Unicode
character U+0180, the set of special characters less so. However, it is
very sporadic from that point. Adding new characters is easy, however;
see the function define-composed-chars. Please send any additions to
zsh-workers@zsh.org.</p>
<p>The codes for the second character when used to accent the first are as
follows. Note that not every character can take every accent.</p>

<p>’<br />
Acute.</p>

<p>0<br />
Circle over the base character.</p>
<p>2<br />
Hook over the base character.</p>
<p>9<br />
Horn over the base character.</p>
<p>The most common characters from the Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek and Hebrew
alphabets are available; consult RFC 1345 for the appropriate sequences.
In addition, a set of two letter codes not in RFC 1345 are available for
the double-width characters corresponding to ASCII characters from ! to
~ (0x21 to 0x7e) by preceding the character with ^, for example ^A for
a double-width A.</p>

<p>insert-files<br />
This function allows you type a file pattern, and see the results of the
expansion at each step. When you hit return, all expansions are inserted
into the command line.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">bindkey '^Xf' insert-files
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-insert_002dunicode_002dchar"></span></p>
<p>insert-unicode-char<br />
When first executed, the user inputs a set of hexadecimal digits. This
is terminated with another call to insert-unicode-char. The digits are
then turned into the corresponding Unicode character. For example, if
the widget is bound to ^XU, the character sequence ‘^XU 4 c ^XU’ inserts
L (Unicode U+004c).</p>
<p>See insert-composed-char for a way of inserting characters using a
two-character mnemonic.</p>

predict-on<br />
This set of functions implements predictive typing using history search.
After predict-on, typing characters causes the editor to look backward
in the history for the first line beginning with what you have typed so
far. After predict-off, editing returns to normal for the line found. In
fact, you often don’t even need to use predict-off, because if the line
doesn’t match something in the history, adding a key performs standard
completion, and then inserts itself if no completions were found.
However, editing in the middle of a line is liable to confuse
prediction; see the toggle style below.</p>
<p>With the function based completion system (which is needed for this),
you should be able to type TAB at almost any point to advance the cursor
to the next ‘‘interesting’’ character position (usually the end of the
current word, but sometimes somewhere in the middle of the word). And of
course as soon as the entire line is what you want, you can accept with
return, without needing to move the cursor to the end first.</p>
<p>The first time predict-on is used, it creates several additional widget
functions:</p>
<p>delete-backward-and-predict<br />
Replaces the backward-delete-char widget. You do not need to bind this
yourself.</p>
<p>insert-and-predict<br />
Implements predictive typing by replacing the self-insert widget. You do
not need to bind this yourself.</p>
<p>predict-off<br />
Turns off predictive typing.</p>
<p>Although you autoload only the predict-on function, it is necessary to
create a keybinding for predict-off as well.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zle -N predict-on
zle -N predict-off
bindkey '^X^Z' predict-on
bindkey '^Z' predict-off
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-read_002dfrom_002dminibuffer"></span></p>
<p>read-from-minibuffer<br />
This is most useful when called as a function from inside a widget, but
will work correctly as a widget in its own right. It prompts for a value
below the current command line; a value may be input using all of the
standard zle operations (and not merely the restricted set available
when executing, for example, execute-named-cmd). The value is then
returned to the calling function in the parameter $REPLY and the editing
buffer restored to its previous state. If the read was aborted by a
keyboard break (typically ^G), the function returns status 1 and $REPLY
is not set.</p>
<p>If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt,
otherwise ‘? ’ is used. If two arguments are supplied, they are the
prompt and the initial value of $LBUFFER, and if a third argument is
given it is the initial value of $RBUFFER. This provides a default value
and starting cursor placement. Upon return the entire buffer is the
value of $REPLY.</p>
<p>One option is available: ‘-k <code>num</code>’ specifies that <code>num</code> characters are
to be read instead of a whole line. The line editor is not invoked
recursively in this case, so depending on the terminal settings the
input may not be visible, and only the input keys are placed in $REPLY,
not the entire buffer. Note that unlike the read builtin <code>num</code> must be
given; there is no default.</p>
<p>The name is a slight misnomer, as in fact the shell’s own minibuffer is
not used. Hence it is still possible to call executed-named-cmd and
similar functions while reading a value.</p>
<p><span id="index-replace_002dargument"></span> <span
id="index-replace_002dargument_002dedit"></span></p>
<p>replace-argument, replace-argument-edit<br />
The function replace-argument can be used to replace a command line
argument in the current command line or, if the current command line is
empty, in the last command line executed (the new command line is not
executed). Arguments are as delimited by standard shell syntax,</p>
<p>If a numeric argument is given, that specifies the argument to be
replaced. 0 means the command name, as in history expansion. A negative
numeric argument counts backward from the last word.</p>
<p>If no numeric argument is given, the current argument is replaced; this
is the last argument if the previous history line is being used.</p>
<p>The function prompts for a replacement argument.</p>
<p>If the widget contains the string edit, for example is defined as</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zle -N replace-argument-edit replace-argument
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>then the function presents the current value of the argument for
editing, otherwise the editing buffer for the replacement is initially
empty.</p>
<p><span id="index-replace_002dstring"></span> <span
id="index-replace_002dstring_002dagain"></span> <span
id="index-replace_002dpattern"></span></p>
<p>replace-string, replace-pattern<br />
replace-string-again, replace-pattern-again<br />
The function replace-string implements three widgets. If defined under
the same name as the function, it prompts for two strings; the first
(source) string will be replaced by the second everywhere it occurs in
the line editing buffer.</p>
<p>If the widget name contains the word ‘pattern’, for example by defining
the widget using the command ‘zle -N replace-pattern replace-string’,
then the matching is performed using zsh patterns. All zsh extended
globbing patterns can be used in the source string; note that unlike
filename generation the pattern does not need to match an entire word,
nor do glob qualifiers have any effect. In addition, the replacement
string can contain parameter or command substitutions. Furthermore, a
‘&amp;’ in the replacement string will be replaced with the matched source
string, and a backquoted digit ‘\<code>N</code>’ will be replaced by the <code>N</code>th
parenthesised expression matched. The form ‘\{<code>N</code>}’ may be used to
protect the digit from following digits.</p>
<p>If the widget instead contains the word ‘regex’ (or ‘regexp’), then the
matching is performed using regular expressions, respecting the setting
of the option RE_MATCH_PCRE (see the description of the function
regexp-replace below). The special replacement facilities described
above for pattern matching are available.</p>
<p>By default the previous source or replacement string will not be offered
for editing. However, this feature can be activated by setting the style
edit-previous in the context :zle:<code>widget</code> (for example,
:zle:replace-string) to true. In addition, a positive numeric argument
forces the previous values to be offered, a negative or zero argument
forces them not to be.</p>
<p>The function replace-string-again can be used to repeat the previous
replacement; no prompting is done. As with replace-string, if the name
of the widget contains the word ‘pattern’ or ‘regex’, pattern or regular
expression matching is performed, else a literal string replacement.
Note that the previous source and replacement text are the same whether
pattern, regular expression or string matching is used.</p>
<p>In addition, replace-string shows the previous replacement above the
prompt, so long as there was one during the current session; if the
source string is empty, that replacement will be repeated without the
widget prompting for a replacement string.</p>
<p>For example, starting from the line:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">print This line contains fan and fond
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>and invoking replace-pattern with the source string ‘f(?)n’ and the
replacement string ‘c\1r’ produces the not very useful line:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">print This line contains car and cord
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The range of the replacement string can be limited by using the
narrow-to-region-invisible widget. One limitation of the current version
is that undo will cycle through changes to the replacement and source
strings before undoing the replacement itself.</p>
<p><span id="index-send_002dinvisible"></span></p>
<p>send-invisible<br />
This is similar to read-from-minibuffer in that it may be called as a
function from a widget or as a widget of its own, and interactively
reads input from the keyboard. However, the input being typed is
concealed and a string of asterisks (‘*’) is shown instead. The value
is saved in the parameter $INVISIBLE to which a reference is inserted
into the editing buffer at the restored cursor position. If the read was
aborted by a keyboard break (typically ^G) or another escape from
editing such as push-line, $INVISIBLE is set to empty and the original
buffer is restored unchanged.</p>
<p>If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt,
otherwise ‘Non-echoed text: ’ is used (as in emacs). If a second and
third argument are supplied they are used to begin and end the reference
to $INVISIBLE that is inserted into the buffer. The default is to open
with ${, then INVISIBLE, and close with }, but many other effects are
possible.</p>
<p><span id="index-smart_002dinsert_002dlast_002dword"></span></p>
<p>smart-insert-last-word<br />
This function may replace the insert-last-word widget, like so:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zle -N insert-last-word smart-insert-last-word
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>With a numeric argument, or when passed command line arguments in a call
from another widget, it behaves like insert-last-word, except that words
in comments are ignored when INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS is set.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the rightmost ‘‘interesting’’ word from the previous command
is found and inserted. The default definition of ‘‘interesting’’ is that
the word contains at least one alphabetic character, slash, or
backslash. This definition may be overridden by use of the match style.
The context used to look up the style is the widget name, so usually the
context is :insert-last-word. However, you can bind this function to
different widgets to use different patterns:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zle -N insert-last-assignment smart-insert-last-word
zstyle :insert-last-assignment match '[[:alpha:]][][[:alnum:]]#=*'
bindkey '\e=' insert-last-assignment
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If no interesting word is found and the auto-previous style is set to a
true value, the search continues upward through the history. When
auto-previous is unset or false (the default), the widget must be
invoked repeatedly in order to search earlier history lines.</p>
<p><span id="index-transpose_002dlines"></span></p>
<p>transpose-lines<br />
Only useful with a multi-line editing buffer; the lines here are lines
within the current on-screen buffer, not history lines. The effect is
similar to the function of the same name in Emacs.</p>
<p>Transpose the current line with the previous line and move the cursor to
the start of the next line. Repeating this (which can be done by
providing a positive numeric argument) has the effect of moving the line
above the cursor down by a number of lines.</p>
<p>With a negative numeric argument, requires two lines above the cursor.
These two lines are transposed and the cursor moved to the start of the
previous line. Using a numeric argument less than -1 has the effect of
moving the line above the cursor up by minus that number of lines.</p>
<p><span id="index-url_002dquote_002dmagic"></span></p>
<p>url-quote-magic<br />
This widget replaces the built-in self-insert to make it easier to type
URLs as command line arguments. As you type, the input character is
analyzed and, if it may need quoting, the current word is checked for a
URI scheme. If one is found and the current word is not already in
quotes, a backslash is inserted before the input character.</p>
<p>Styles to control quoting behavior:</p>
<p>url-metas<br />
This style is looked up in the context ‘:url-quote-magic:<code>scheme</code>’
(where <code>scheme</code> is that of the current URL, e.g. &quot;ftp&quot;). The value is a
string listing the characters to be treated as globbing metacharacters
when appearing in a URL using that scheme. The default is to quote all
zsh extended globbing characters, excluding ’&lt;’ and ’&gt;’ but including
braces (as in brace expansion). See also url-seps.</p>
<p>url-seps<br />
Like url-metas, but lists characters that should be considered command
separators, redirections, history references, etc. The default is to
quote the standard set of shell separators, excluding those that overlap
with the extended globbing characters, but including ’&lt;’ and ’&gt;’ and
the first character of $histchars.</p>
<p>url-globbers<br />
This style is looked up in the context ‘:url-quote-magic’. The values
form a list of command names that are expected to do their own globbing
on the URL string. This implies that they are aliased to use the
‘noglob’ modifier. When the first word on the line matches one of the
values <em>and</em> the URL refers to a local file (see url-local-schema), only
the url-seps characters are quoted; the url-metas are left alone,
allowing them to affect command-line parsing, completion, etc. The
default values are a literal ‘noglob’ plus (when the zsh/parameter
module is available) any commands aliased to the helper function
‘urlglobber’ or its alias ‘globurl’.</p>
<p>url-local-schema<br />
This style is always looked up in the context ‘:urlglobber’, even though
it is used by both url-quote-magic and urlglobber. The values form a
list of URI schema that should be treated as referring to local files by
their real local path names, as opposed to files which are specified
relative to a web-server-defined document root. The defaults are &quot;ftp&quot;
and &quot;file&quot;.</p>
<p>url-other-schema<br />
Like url-local-schema, but lists all other URI schema upon which
urlglobber and url-quote-magic should act. If the URI on the command
line does not have a scheme appearing either in this list or in
url-local-schema, it is not magically quoted. The default values are
&quot;http&quot;, &quot;https&quot;, and &quot;ftp&quot;. When a scheme appears both here and in
url-local-schema, it is quoted differently depending on whether the
command name appears in url-globbers.</p>
<p>Loading url-quote-magic also defines a helper function ‘urlglobber’ and
aliases ‘globurl’ to ‘noglob urlglobber’. This function takes a local
URL apart, attempts to pattern-match the local file portion of the URL
path, and then puts the results back into URL format again.</p>
<p><span id="index-vi_002dpipe"></span></p>
<p>vi-pipe<br />
This function reads a movement command from the keyboard and then
prompts for an external command. The part of the buffer covered by the
movement is piped to the external command and then replaced by the
command’s output. If the movement command is bound to vi-pipe, the
current line is used.</p>
<p>The function serves as an example for reading a vi movement command from
within a user-defined widget.</p>
<p><span id="index-which_002dcommand-1"></span></p>
<p>which-command<br />
This function is a drop-in replacement for the builtin widget
which-command. It has enhanced behaviour, in that it correctly detects
whether or not the command word needs to be expanded as an alias; if so,
it continues tracing the command word from the expanded alias until it
reaches the command that will be executed.</p>
<p>The style whence is available in the context :zle:$WIDGET; this may be
set to an array to give the command and options that will be used to
investigate the command word found. The default is whence -c.</p>
<p><span id="index-zcalc_002dauto_002dinsert"></span></p>
<p>zcalc-auto-insert<br />
This function is useful together with the zcalc function described in
<a href="#Mathematical-Functions">Mathematical Functions</a>. It should be bound to
a key representing a binary operator such as ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’ or ‘/’. When
running in zcalc, if the key occurs at the start of the line or
immediately following an open parenthesis, the text &quot;ans &quot; is inserted
before the representation of the key itself. This allows easy use of the
answer from the previous calculation in the current line. The text to be
inserted before the symbol typed can be modified by setting the variable
ZCALC_AUTO_INSERT_PREFIX.</p>
<p>Hence, for example, typing ‘+12’ followed by return adds 12 to the
previous result.</p>
<p>If zcalc is in RPN mode (-r option) the effect of this binding is
automatically suppressed as operators alone on a line are meaningful.</p>
<p>When not in zcalc, the key simply inserts the symbol itself.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Utility-Functions"></span></p>
<h3 id="2672-utility-functions"><a class="header" href="#2672-utility-functions">26.7.2 Utility Functions</a></h3>
<p>These functions are useful in constructing widgets. They should be
loaded with ‘autoload -U <code>function</code>’ and called as indicated from
user-defined widgets.</p>
<p><span id="index-split_002dshell_002darguments"></span></p>
<p>split-shell-arguments</p>
<p>This function splits the line currently being edited into shell
arguments and whitespace. The result is stored in the array reply. The
array contains all the parts of the line in order, starting with any
whitespace before the first argument, and finishing with any whitespace
after the last argument. Hence (so long as the option KSH_ARRAYS is not
set) whitespace is given by odd indices in the array and arguments by
even indices. Note that no stripping of quotes is done; joining together
all the elements of reply in order is guaranteed to produce the original
line.</p>
<p>The parameter REPLY is set to the index of the word in reply which
contains the character after the cursor, where the first element has
index 1. The parameter REPLY2 is set to the index of the character under
the cursor in that word, where the first character has index 1.</p>
<p>Hence reply, REPLY and REPLY2 should all be made local to the enclosing
function.</p>
<p>See the function modify-current-argument, described below, for an
example of how to call this function.</p>
<p><span id="index-modify_002dcurrent_002dargument"></span></p>
<p>modify-current-argument [ <code>expr-using-</code>$ARG | <code>func</code> ]</p>
<p>This function provides a simple method of allowing user-defined widgets
to modify the command line argument under the cursor (or immediately to
the left of the cursor if the cursor is between arguments).</p>
<p>The argument can be an expression which when evaluated operates on the
shell parameter ARG, which will have been set to the command line
argument under the cursor. The expression should be suitably quoted to
prevent it being evaluated too early.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the argument does not contain the string ARG, it is
assumed to be a shell function, to which the current command line
argument is passed as the only argument. The function should set the
variable REPLY to the new value for the command line argument. If the
function returns non-zero status, so does the calling function.</p>
<p>For example, a user-defined widget containing the following code
converts the characters in the argument under the cursor into all upper
case:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">modify-current-argument '${(U)ARG}'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The following strips any quoting from the current word (whether
backslashes or one of the styles of quotes), and replaces it with single
quoting throughout:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">modify-current-argument '${(qq)${(Q)ARG}}'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The following performs directory expansion on the command line argument
and replaces it by the absolute path:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">expand-dir() {
  REPLY=${~1}
  REPLY=${REPLY:a}
}
modify-current-argument expand-dir
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In practice the function expand-dir would probably not be defined within
the widget where modify-current-argument is called.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Styles-2"></span></p>
<h3 id="2673-styles"><a class="header" href="#2673-styles">26.7.3 Styles</a></h3>
<p>The behavior of several of the above widgets can be controlled by the
use of the zstyle mechanism. In particular, widgets that interact with
the completion system pass along their context to any completions that
they invoke.</p>
<p><span id="index-break_002dkeys_002c-widget-style"></span></p>
<p>break-keys</p>
<p>This style is used by the incremental-complete-word widget. Its value
should be a pattern, and all keys matching this pattern will cause the
widget to stop incremental completion without the key having any further
effect. Like all styles used directly by incremental-complete-word, this
style is looked up using the context ‘:incremental’.</p>
<p><span id="index-completer_002c-completion-style-1"></span></p>
<p>completer</p>
<p>The incremental-complete-word and insert-and-predict widgets set up
their top-level context name before calling completion. This allows one
to define different sets of completer functions for normal completion
and for these widgets. For example, to use completion, approximation and
correction for normal completion, completion and correction for
incremental completion and only completion for prediction one could use:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':completion:*' completer \ 
        _complete _correct _approximate
zstyle ':completion:incremental:*' completer \ 
        _complete _correct
zstyle ':completion:predict:*' completer \ 
        _complete
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>It is a good idea to restrict the completers used in prediction, because
they may be automatically invoked as you type. The _list and _menu
completers should never be used with prediction. The _approximate,
_correct, _expand, and _match completers may be used, but be aware
that they may change characters anywhere in the word behind the cursor,
so you need to watch carefully that the result is what you intended.</p>
<p><span id="index-cursor_002c-completion-style"></span></p>
<p>cursor</p>
<p>The insert-and-predict widget uses this style, in the context
‘:predict’, to decide where to place the cursor after completion has
been tried. Values are:</p>
<p>complete<br />
The cursor is left where it was when completion finished, but only if it
is after a character equal to the one just inserted by the user. If it
is after another character, this value is the same as ‘key’.</p>
<p>key<br />
The cursor is left after the <code>n</code>th occurrence of the character just
inserted, where <code>n</code> is the number of times that character appeared in
the word before completion was attempted. In short, this has the effect
of leaving the cursor after the character just typed even if the
completion code found out that no other characters need to be inserted
at that position.</p>
<p>Any other value for this style unconditionally leaves the cursor at the
position where the completion code left it.</p>
<p><span id="index-list_002c-widget-style"></span></p>
<p>list</p>
<p>When using the incremental-complete-word widget, this style says if the
matches should be listed on every key press (if they fit on the screen).
Use the context prefix ‘:completion:incremental’.</p>
<p>The insert-and-predict widget uses this style to decide if the
completion should be shown even if there is only one possible
completion. This is done if the value of this style is the string
always. In this case the context is ‘:predict’ (<em>not</em>
‘:completion:predict’).</p>
<p><span id="index-match_002c-widget-style"></span></p>
<p>match</p>
<p>This style is used by smart-insert-last-word to provide a pattern (using
full EXTENDED_GLOB syntax) that matches an interesting word. The context
is the name of the widget to which smart-insert-last-word is bound (see
above). The default behavior of smart-insert-last-word is equivalent to:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle :insert-last-word match '*[[:alpha:]/\\]*'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>However, you might want to include words that contain spaces:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle :insert-last-word match '*[[:alpha:][:space:]/\\]*'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Or include numbers as long as the word is at least two characters long:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle :insert-last-word match '*([[:digit:]]?|[[:alpha:]/\\])*'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The above example causes redirections like &quot;2&gt;&quot; to be included.</p>
<p><span id="index-prompt_002c-widget-style"></span></p>
<p>prompt</p>
<p>The incremental-complete-word widget shows the value of this style in
the status line during incremental completion. The string value may
contain any of the following substrings in the manner of the PS1 and
other prompt parameters:</p>
<p>%c<br />
Replaced by the name of the completer function that generated the
matches (without the leading underscore).</p>
<p>%l<br />
When the list style is set, replaced by ‘...’ if the list of matches is
too long to fit on the screen and with an empty string otherwise. If the
list style is ‘false’ or not set, ‘%l’ is always removed.</p>
<p>%n<br />
Replaced by the number of matches generated.</p>
<p>%s<br />
Replaced by ‘-no match-’, ‘-no prefix-’, or an empty string if there is
no completion matching the word on the line, if the matches have no
common prefix different from the word on the line, or if there is such a
common prefix, respectively.</p>
<p>%u<br />
Replaced by the unambiguous part of all matches, if there is any, and if
it is different from the word on the line.</p>
<p>Like ‘break-keys’, this uses the ‘:incremental’ context.</p>
<p><span id="index-stop_002dkeys_002c-widget-style"></span></p>
<p>stop-keys</p>
<p>This style is used by the incremental-complete-word widget. Its value is
treated similarly to the one for the break-keys style (and uses the same
context: ‘:incremental’). However, in this case all keys matching the
pattern given as its value will stop incremental completion and will
then execute their usual function.</p>
<p><span id="index-toggle_002c-widget-style"></span></p>
<p>toggle</p>
<p>This boolean style is used by predict-on and its related widgets in the
context ‘:predict’. If set to one of the standard ‘true’ values,
predictive typing is automatically toggled off in situations where it is
unlikely to be useful, such as when editing a multi-line buffer or after
moving into the middle of a line and then deleting a character. The
default is to leave prediction turned on until an explicit call to
predict-off.</p>
<p><span id="index-verbose_002c-widget-style"></span></p>
<p>verbose</p>
<p>This boolean style is used by predict-on and its related widgets in the
context ‘:predict’. If set to one of the standard ‘true’ values, these
widgets display a message below the prompt when the predictive state is
toggled. This is most useful in combination with the toggle style. The
default does not display these messages.</p>
<p><span id="index-widget_002c-widget-style"></span></p>
<p>widget</p>
<p>This style is similar to the command style: For widget functions that
use zle to call other widgets, this style can sometimes be used to
override the widget which is called. The context for this style is the
name of the calling widget (<em>not</em> the name of the calling function,
because one function may be bound to multiple widget names).</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle :copy-earlier-word widget smart-insert-last-word
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Check the documentation for the calling widget or function to determine
whether the widget style is used.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Exception-Handling"></span> <span
id="Exception-Handling-1"></span></p>
<h2 id="268-exception-handling"><a class="header" href="#268-exception-handling">26.8 Exception Handling</a></h2>
<p>Two functions are provided to enable zsh to provide exception handling
in a form that should be familiar from other languages.</p>
<p><span id="index-throw"></span></p>
<p>throw <code>exception</code></p>
<p>The function throw throws the named <code>exception</code>. The name is an
arbitrary string and is only used by the throw and catch functions. An
exception is for the most part treated the same as a shell error, i.e.
an unhandled exception will cause the shell to abort all processing in a
function or script and to return to the top level in an interactive
shell.</p>
<p>catch <code>exception-pattern</code></p>
<p>The function catch returns status zero if an exception was thrown and
the pattern <code>exception-pattern</code> matches its name. Otherwise it returns
status 1. <code>exception-pattern</code> is a standard shell pattern, respecting
the current setting of the EXTENDED_GLOB option. An alias catch is also
defined to prevent the argument to the function from matching filenames,
so patterns may be used unquoted. Note that as exceptions are not
fundamentally different from other shell errors it is possible to catch
shell errors by using an empty string as the exception name. The shell
variable CAUGHT is set by catch to the name of the exception caught. It
is possible to rethrow an exception by calling the throw function again
once an exception has been caught. <span id="index-catch"></span></p>
<p>The functions are designed to be used together with the always construct
described in <a href="Shell-Grammar.html#Complex-Commands">Complex Commands</a>.
This is important as only this construct provides the required support
for exceptions. A typical example is as follows.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">{
  # &quot;try&quot; block
  # ... nested code here calls &quot;throw MyExcept&quot;
} always {
  # &quot;always&quot; block
  if catch MyExcept; then
    print &quot;Caught exception MyExcept&quot;
  elif catch ''; then
    print &quot;Caught a shell error.  Propagating...&quot;
    throw ''
  fi
  # Other exceptions are not handled but may be caught further
  # up the call stack.
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If all exceptions should be caught, the following idiom might be
preferable.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">{
  # ... nested code here throws an exception
} always {
  if catch *; then
    case $CAUGHT in
      (MyExcept)
      print &quot;Caught my own exception&quot;
      ;;
      (*)
      print &quot;Caught some other exception&quot;
      ;;
    esac
  fi
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In common with exception handling in other languages, the exception may
be thrown by code deeply nested inside the ‘try’ block. However, note
that it must be thrown inside the current shell, not in a subshell
forked for a pipeline, parenthesised current-shell construct, or some
form of command or process substitution.</p>
<p>The system internally uses the shell variable EXCEPTION to record the
name of the exception between throwing and catching. One drawback of
this scheme is that if the exception is not handled the variable
EXCEPTION remains set and may be incorrectly recognised as the name of
an exception if a shell error subsequently occurs. Adding unset
EXCEPTION at the start of the outermost layer of any code that uses
exception handling will eliminate this problem.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="MIME-Functions"></span> <span id="MIME-Functions-1"></span></p>
<h2 id="269-mime-functions"><a class="header" href="#269-mime-functions">26.9 MIME Functions</a></h2>
<p>Three functions are available to provide handling of files recognised by
extension, for example to dispatch a file text.ps when executed as a
command to an appropriate viewer.</p>
<p><span id="index-zsh_002dmime_002dsetup"></span> <span
id="index-zsh_002dmime_002dhandler"></span></p>
<p>zsh-mime-setup [ -fv ] [ -l [ <code>suffix</code> ... ] ]</p>
<p>zsh-mime-handler [ -l ] <code>command argument</code> ...</p>
<p>These two functions use the files ~/.mime.types and /etc/mime.types,
which associate types and extensions, as well as ~/.mailcap and
/etc/mailcap files, which associate types and the programs that handle
them. These are provided on many systems with the Multimedia Internet
Mail Extensions.</p>
<p>To enable the system, the function zsh-mime-setup should be autoloaded
and run. This allows files with extensions to be treated The function
zsh-mime-handler should not need to be called by the user.</p>
<p>The system works by setting up suffix aliases with ‘alias -s’. Suffix
aliases already installed by the user will not be overwritten.</p>
<p>For suffixes defined in lower case, upper case variants will also
automatically be handled (e.g. PDF is automatically handled if handling
for the suffix pdf is defined), but not vice versa.</p>
<p>Repeated calls to zsh-mime-setup do not override the existing is given.
Note, however, that this does not override existing suffix aliases
assigned to handlers other than zsh-mime-handler.</p>
<p>Calling zsh-mime-setup with the option -l lists the existing mappings
without altering them. Suffixes to list (which may contain pattern
characters that should be quoted from immediate interpretation on the
command line) may be given as additional arguments, otherwise all
suffixes are listed.</p>
<p>Calling zsh-mime-setup with the option -v causes verbose output to be
shown during the setup operation.</p>
<p>The system respects the mailcap flags needsterminal and copiousoutput;
see mailcap(4) or mailcap(5) (the man page’s name varies across
platforms).</p>
<p>The functions use the following styles, which are defined with the
zstyle builtin command (<a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fzutil-Module">The zsh/zutil
Module</a>). They should be
defined before zsh-mime-setup is run. The contexts used all start with
:mime:, with additional components in some cases. It is recommended that
a trailing * (suitably quoted) be appended to style patterns in case
the system is extended in future. Some examples are given below.</p>
<p>For files that have multiple suffixes, e.g. .pdf.gz, where the context
includes the suffix it will be looked up starting with the longest
possible suffix until a match for the style is found. For example, if
.pdf.gz produces a match for the handler, that will be used; otherwise
the handler for .gz will be used. Note that, owing to the way suffix
aliases work, it is always required that there be a handler for the
shortest possible suffix, so in this example .pdf.gz can only be handled
if .gz is also handled (though not necessarily in the same way).
Alternatively, if no handling for .gz on its own is needed, simply
adding the command</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">alias -s gz=zsh-mime-handler
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>to the initialisation code is sufficient; .gz will not be handled on its
own, but may be in combination with other suffixes.</p>
<p><span id="index-current_002dshell_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>current-shell</p>
<p>If this boolean style is true, the mailcap handler for the context in
question is run using the eval builtin instead of by starting a new sh
process. This is more efficient, but may not work in the occasional
cases where the mailcap handler uses strict POSIX syntax.</p>
<p><span id="index-disown_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>disown</p>
<p>If this boolean style is true, mailcap handlers started in the
background will be disowned, i.e. not subject to job control within the
parent shell. Such handlers nearly always produce their own windows, so
the only likely harmful side effect of setting the style is that it
becomes harder to kill jobs from within the shell.</p>
<p><span id="index-execute_002das_002dis_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>execute-as-is</p>
<p>This style gives a list of patterns to be matched against files passed
for execution with a handler program. If the file matches the pattern,
the entire command line is executed in its current form, with no
handler. This is useful for files which might have suffixes is not set,
the pattern *(*) *(/) is used; handler, and the option AUTO_CD may be
used to change to directories that happen to have MIME suffixes.</p>
<p><span id="index-execute_002dnever_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>execute-never</p>
<p>This style is useful in combination with execute-as-is. It is set to an
array of patterns corresponding to full paths to files that the MIME
handler matches execute-as-is. This is useful for file from another
operating system. For example, if /mnt/windows is a Windows mount, then</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':mime:*' execute-never '/mnt/windows/*'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>will ensure that any files found in that area will be executed as MIME
file name is matched against the pattern, regardless of how the file was
passed to the handler. The file is resolved to a full path using the :P
modifier described in <a href="Expansion.html#Modifiers">Modifiers</a>; this means
that symbolic links are resolved where possible, so that links into
other file systems behave in the correct fashion.</p>
<p><span id="index-file_002dpath_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>file-path</p>
<p>Used if the style find-file-in-path is true for the same context. Set to
an array of directories that are used for searching for the file to be
handled; the default is the command path given by the special parameter
path. The shell option PATH_DIRS is respected; if that is set, the
appropriate path will be searched even if the name of the file to be
handled as it appears on the command line contains a ‘/’. The full
context is :mime:.<code>suffix</code>:, as described for the style handler.</p>
<p><span id="index-find_002dfile_002din_002dpath_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>find-file-in-path</p>
<p>If set, allows files whose names do not contain absolute paths to be
searched for in the command path or the path specified by the file-path
style. If the file is not found in the path, it is looked for locally
(whether or not the current directory is in the path); if it is not
found locally, the handler will abort unless the handle-nonexistent
style is set. Files found in the path are tested as described for the
style execute-as-is. The full context is :mime:.<code>suffix</code>:, as described
for the style handler.</p>
<p><span id="index-flags_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>flags</p>
<p>Defines flags to go with a handler; the context is as for the handler
style, and the format is as for the flags in mailcap.</p>
<p><span id="index-handle_002dnonexistent_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>handle-nonexistent</p>
<p>By default, arguments that don’t correspond to files are not passed to
the MIME handler in order to prevent it from intercepting commands found
in the path that happen to have suffixes. This style may be set to an
array of extended glob patterns for arguments that will be passed to the
handler even if they don’t exist. If it is not explicitly set it
defaults to [[:alpha:]]#:/* which allows URLs to be passed to the
MIME handler even though they don’t exist in that format in the file
system. The full context is :mime:.<code>suffix</code>:, as described for the style
handler.</p>
<p><span id="index-handler_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>handler</p>
<p>Specifies a handler for a suffix; the suffix is given by the context as
:mime:.<code>suffix</code>:, and the format of the handler is exactly that in
mailcap. Note in particular the ‘.’ and trailing colon to distinguish
this use of the context. This overrides any handler specified by the
mailcap files. If the handler requires a terminal, the flags style
should be set to include the word needsterminal, or if the output is to
be displayed through a pager (but not if the handler is itself a pager),
it should include copiousoutput.</p>
<p><span id="index-mailcap_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>mailcap</p>
<p>A list of files in the format of ~/.mailcap and /etc/mailcap to be read
during setup, replacing the default list which consists of those two
files. The context is :mime:. A + in the list will be replaced by the
default files.</p>
<p><span id="index-mailcap_002dpriorities_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>mailcap-priorities</p>
<p>This style is used to resolve multiple mailcap entries for the same MIME
type. It consists of an array of the following elements, in descending
order of priority; later entries will be used if earlier entries are
unable to resolve the entries being compared. If none of the tests
resolve the entries, the first entry encountered is retained.</p>
<p>files<br />
The order of files (entries in the mailcap style) read. Earlier files
are preferred. (Note this does not resolve entries in the same file.)</p>
<p>priority<br />
The priority flag from the mailcap entry. The priority is an integer
from 0 to 9 with the default value being 5.</p>
<p>flags<br />
The test given by the mailcap-prio-flags option is used to resolve
entries.</p>
<p>place<br />
Later entries are preferred; as the entries are strictly ordered, this
test always succeeds.</p>
<p>Note that as this style is handled during initialisation, the context is
always :mime:, with no discrimination by suffix.</p>
<p><span id="index-mailcap_002dprio_002dflags_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>mailcap-prio-flags</p>
<p>This style is used when the keyword flags is encountered in the list of
tests specified by the mailcap-priorities style. It should be set to a
list of patterns, each of which is tested against the flags specified in
the mailcap entry (in other words, the sets of assignments found with
some entries in the mailcap file). Earlier patterns in the list are
preferred to later ones, and matched patterns are preferred to unmatched
ones.</p>
<p><span id="index-mime_002dtypes_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>mime-types</p>
<p>A list of files in the format of ~/.mime.types and /etc/mime.types to
be read during setup, replacing the default list which consists of those
two files. The context is :mime:. A + in the list will be replaced by
the default files.</p>
<p><span id="index-never_002dbackground_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>never-background</p>
<p>If this boolean style is set, the handler for the given context is
always run in the foreground, even if the flags provided in the mailcap
entry suggest it need not be (for example, it doesn’t require a
terminal).</p>
<p><span id="index-pager_002c-MIME-style"></span></p>
<p>pager</p>
<p>If set, will be used instead of $PAGER or more to handle suffixes where
the copiousoutput flag is set. The context is as for handler, i.e.
:mime:.<code>suffix</code>: for handling a file with the given <code>suffix</code>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':mime:*' mailcap ~/.mailcap /usr/local/etc/mailcap
zstyle ':mime:.txt:' handler less %s
zstyle ':mime:.txt:' flags needsterminal
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>When zsh-mime-setup is subsequently run, it will look for mailcap
entries in the two files given. Files of suffix .txt will be handled by
running ‘less <code>file.txt</code>’. The flag needsterminal is set to show that
this program must run attached to a terminal.</p>
<p>As there are several steps to dispatching a command, the following
should be checked if attempting to execute a file by extension .<code>ext</code>
does not have the expected effect.</p>
<p>The command ‘alias -s <code>ext</code>’ should show ‘ps=zsh-mime-handler’. If it
shows something else, another suffix alias was already installed and was
not overwritten. If it shows nothing, no handler was installed: this is
most likely because no handler was found in the .mime.types and mailcap
combination for .ext files. In that case, appropriate handling should be
added to ~/.mime.types and mailcap.</p>
<p>If the extension is handled by zsh-mime-handler but the file is not
opened correctly, either the handler defined for the type is incorrect,
or the flags associated with it are in appropriate. Running
zsh-mime-setup -l will show the handler and, if there are any, the
flags. A %s in the handler is replaced by the file (suitably quoted if
necessary). Check that the handler program listed lists and can be run
in the way shown. Also check that the flags needsterminal or
copiousoutput are set if the handler needs to be run under a terminal;
the second flag is used if the output should be sent to a pager.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">text/html; /usr/bin/lynx '%s'; needsterminal
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Running ‘zsh-mime-handler -l <code>command line</code>’ prints the command line
that would be executed, simplified to remove the effect of any flags,
and quoted so that the output can be run as a complete zsh command line.
This is used by the completion system to decide how to complete after a
file handled by zsh-mime-setup.</p>
<p><span id="index-pick_002dweb_002dbrowser"></span></p>
<p>pick-web-browser</p>
<p>This function is separate from the two MIME functions described above
and can be assigned directly to a suffix:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">autoload -U pick-web-browser
alias -s html=pick-web-browser
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>It is provided as an intelligent front end to dispatch a web browser. It
may be run as either a function or a shell script. The status 255 is
returned if no browser could be started.</p>
<p>Various styles are available to customize the choice of browsers:</p>
<p>browser-style<br />
The value of the style is an array giving preferences in decreasing
order for the type of browser to use. The values of elements may be</p>
<p>running<br />
Use a GUI browser that is already running when an X Window display is
available. The browsers listed in the x-browsers style are tried in
order until one is found; if it is, the file will be displayed in that
browser, so the user may need to check whether it has appeared. If no
running browser is found, one is not started. Browsers other than
Firefox, Opera and Konqueror are assumed to understand the Mozilla
syntax for opening a URL remotely.</p>
<p>x<br />
Start a new GUI browser when an X Window display is available. Search
for the availability of one of the browsers listed in the x-browsers
style and start the first one that is found. No check is made for an
already running browser.</p>
<p>tty<br />
Start a terminal-based browser. Search for the availability of one of
the browsers listed in the tty-browsers style and start the first one
that is found.</p>
<p>If the style is not set the default running x tty is used.</p>
<p>x-browsers<br />
An array in decreasing order of preference of browsers to use when
running under the X Window System. The array consists of the command
name under which to start the browser. They are looked up in the context
:mime: (which may be extended in future, so appending ‘*’ is
recommended). For example,</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle ':mime:*' x-browsers opera konqueror firefox
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>specifies that pick-web-browser should first look for a running instance
of Opera, Konqueror or Firefox, in that order, and if it fails to find
any should attempt to start Opera. The default is firefox mozilla
netscape opera konqueror.</p>
<p>tty-browsers<br />
An array similar to x-browsers, except that it gives browsers to use
when no X Window display is available. The default is elinks links lynx.</p>
<p>command<br />
If it is set this style is used to pick the command used to open a page
for a browser. The context is :mime:browser:new:$browser: to start a new
browser or :mime:browser:running:$browser: to open a URL in a browser
already running on the current X display, where $browser is the value
matched in the x-browsers or tty-browsers style. The escape sequence %b
in the style’s value will be replaced by the browser, while %u will be
replaced by the URL. If the style is not set, the default for all new
instances is equivalent to %b %u and the defaults for using running
browsers are equivalent to the values kfmclient openURL %u for
Konqueror, firefox -new-tab %u for Firefox, opera -newpage %u for Opera,
and %b -remote &quot;openUrl(%u)&quot; for all others.</p>

<h2 id="2610-mathematical-functions"><a class="header" href="#2610-mathematical-functions">26.10 Mathematical Functions</a></h2>
<p><span id="index-zcalc"></span></p>
<p>zcalc [ -erf ] [ <code>expression</code> ... ]</p>
<p>A reasonably powerful calculator based on zsh’s arithmetic evaluation
facility. The syntax is similar to that of formulae in most programming
languages; see <a href="Arithmetic-Evaluation.html#Arithmetic-Evaluation">Arithmetic
Evaluation</a> for
details.</p>
<p>Non-programmers should note that, as in many other programming
languages, expressions involving only integers (whether constants
without a ‘.’, variables containing such constants as strings, or
variables declared to be integers) are by default evaluated using
integer arithmetic, which is not how an ordinary desk calculator
operates. To force floating point operation, pass the option -f; see
further notes below.</p>
<p>If the file ~/.zcalcrc exists it will be sourced inside the function
once it is set up and about to process the command line. This can be
used, for example, to set shell options; emulate -L zsh and setopt
extendedglob are in effect at this point. Any failure to source the file
if it exists is treated as fatal. As with other initialisation files,
the directory $ZDOTDIR is used instead of $HOME if it is set.</p>
<p>The mathematical library zsh/mathfunc will be loaded if it is available;
see <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fmathfunc-Module">The zsh/mathfunc
Module</a>. The mathematical
functions correspond to the raw system libraries, so trigonometric
functions are evaluated using radians, and so on.</p>
<p>Each line typed is evaluated as an expression. The prompt shows a
number, which corresponds to a positional parameter where the result of
that calculation is stored. For example, the result of the calculation
on the line preceded by ‘4&gt; ’ is available as $4. The last value
calculated is available as ans. Full command line editing, including the
history of previous calculations, is available; the history is saved in
the file ~/.zcalc_history. To exit, enter a blank line or type ‘:q’ on
its own (‘q’ is allowed for historical compatibility).</p>
<p>A line ending with a single backslash is treated in the same fashion as
it is in command line editing: the backslash is removed, the function
prompts for more input (the prompt is preceded by ‘...’ to indicate
this), and the lines are combined into one to get the final result. In
addition, if the input so far contains more open than close parentheses
zcalc will prompt for more input.</p>
<p>If arguments are given to zcalc on start up, they are used to prime the
first few positional parameters. A visual indication of this is given
when the calculator starts.</p>
<p>The constants PI (3.14159...) and E (2.71828...) are provided. Parameter
assignment is possible, but note that all parameters will be put into
the global namespace unless the :local special command is used. The
function creates local variables whose names start with _, so users
should avoid doing so. The variables ans (the last answer) and stack
(the stack in RPN mode) may be referred to directly; stack is an array
but elements of it are numeric. Various other special variables are used
locally with their standard meaning, for example compcontext, match,
mbegin, mend, psvar.</p>
<p>The output base can be initialised by passing the option ‘-#<code>base</code>’, for
example ‘zcalc -#16’ (the ‘#’ may have to be quoted, depending on the
globbing options set).</p>
<p>If the option ‘-e’ is set, the function runs non-interactively: the
arguments are treated as expressions to be evaluated as if entered
interactively line by line.</p>
<p>If the option ‘-f’ is set, all numbers are treated as floating point,
hence for example the expression ‘3/4’ evaluates to 0.75 rather than 0.
Options must appear in separate words.</p>
<p>If the option ‘-r’ is set, RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) mode is
entered. This has various additional properties:</p>
<p>Stack<br />
Evaluated values are maintained in a stack; this is contained in an
array named stack with the most recent value in ${stack[1]}.</p>
<p>Operators and functions<br />
If the line entered matches an operator (+, -, *, /, **, ^, | or &amp;)
or a function supplied by the zsh/mathfunc library, the bottom element
or elements of the stack are popped to use as the argument or arguments.
The higher elements of stack (least recent) are used as earlier
arguments. The result is then pushed into ${stack[1]}.</p>
<p>Expressions<br />
Other expressions are evaluated normally, printed, and added to the
stack as numeric values. The syntax within expressions on a single line
is normal shell arithmetic (not RPN).</p>
<p>Stack listing<br />
If an integer follows the option -r with no space, then on every
evaluation that many elements of the stack, where available, are printed
instead of just the most recent result. Hence, for example, zcalc -r4
shows $stack[4] to $stack[1] each time results are printed.</p>
<p>Duplication: =<br />
The pseudo-operator = causes the most recent element of the stack to be
duplicated onto the stack.</p>
<p>pop<br />
The pseudo-function pop causes the most recent element of the stack to
be popped. A ‘&gt;’ on its own has the same effect.</p>
<p>&gt;<code>ident</code><br />
The expression &gt; followed (with no space) by a shell identifier causes
the most recent element of the stack to be popped and assigned to the
variable with that name. The variable is local to the zcalc function.</p>
<p>&lt;<code>ident</code><br />
The expression &lt; followed (with no space) by a shell identifier causes
the value of the variable with that name to be pushed onto the stack.
<code>ident</code> may be an integer, in which case the previous result with that
number (as shown before the &gt; in the standard zcalc prompt) is put on
the stack.</p>
<p>Exchange: xy<br />
The pseudo-function xy causes the most recent two elements of the stack
to be exchanged. ‘&lt;&gt;’ has the same effect.</p>
<p>The prompt is configurable via the parameter ZCALCPROMPT, which
undergoes standard prompt expansion. The index of the current entry is
stored locally in the first element of the array psvar, which can be
referred to in ZCALCPROMPT as ‘%1v’. The default prompt is ‘%1v&gt; ’.</p>
<p>The variable ZCALC_ACTIVE is set within the function and can be tested
by nested functions; it has the value rpn if RPN mode is active, else 1.</p>
<p>A few special commands are available; these are introduced by a colon.
For backward compatibility, the colon may be omitted for certain
commands. Completion is available if compinit has been run.</p>
<p>The output precision may be specified within zcalc by special commands
familiar from many calculators.</p>
<p>:norm<br />
The default output format. It corresponds to the printf %g
specification. Typically this shows six decimal digits.</p>
<p>:sci <code>digits</code><br />
Scientific notation, corresponding to the printf %g output format with
the precision given by <code>digits</code>. This produces either fixed point or
exponential notation depending on the value output.</p>
<p>:fix <code>digits</code><br />
Fixed point notation, corresponding to the printf %f output format with
the precision given by <code>digits</code>.</p>
<p>:eng <code>digits</code><br />
Exponential notation, corresponding to the printf %E output format with
the precision given by <code>digits</code>.</p>
<p>:raw<br />
Raw output: this is the default form of the output from a math
evaluation. This may show more precision than the number actually
possesses.</p>
<p>Other special commands:</p>
<p>:!<code>line...</code><br />
Execute <code>line...</code> as a normal shell command line. Note that it is
executed in the context of the function, i.e. with local variables.
Space is optional after :!.</p>
<p>:local <code>arg</code> ...<br />
Declare variables local to the function. Other variables may be used,
too, but they will be taken from or put into the global scope.</p>
<p>:function <code>name</code> [ <code>body</code> ]<br />
Define a mathematical function or (with no <code>body</code>) delete it. :function
may be abbreviated to :func or simply :f. The <code>name</code> may contain the
same characters as a shell function name. The function is defined using
zmathfuncdef, see below.</p>
<p>Note that zcalc takes care of all quoting. Hence for example:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">:f cube $1 * $1 * $1
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>defines a function to cube the sole argument. Functions so defined, or
indeed any functions defined directly or indirectly using functions -M,
are available to execute by typing only the name on the line in RPN
mode; this pops the appropriate number of arguments off the stack to
pass to the function, i.e. 1 in the case of the example cube function.
If there are optional arguments only the mandatory arguments are
supplied by this means.</p>
<p>[#<code>base</code>]<br />
This is not a special command, rather part of normal arithmetic syntax;
however, when this form appears on a line by itself the default output
radix is set to <code>base</code>. Use, for example, ‘[#16]’ to display
hexadecimal output preceded by an indication of the base, or ‘[##16]’
just to display the raw number in the given base. Bases themselves are
always specified in decimal. ‘[#]’ restores the normal output format.
Note that setting an output base suppresses floating point output; use
‘[#]’ to return to normal operation.</p>
<p>$<code>var</code><br />
Print out the value of var literally; does not affect the calculation.
To use the value of var, omit the leading ‘$’.</p>
<p>See the comments in the function for a few extra tips.</p>
<p><span id="index-max"></span> <span id="index-min"></span> <span
id="index-sum"></span> <span id="index-zmathfunc"></span></p>
<p>min(<code>arg</code>, ...)</p>
<p>max(<code>arg</code>, ...)</p>
<p>sum(<code>arg</code>, ...)</p>
<p>zmathfunc</p>
<p>The function zmathfunc defines the three mathematical functions min,
max, and sum. The functions min and max take one or more arguments. The
function sum takes zero or more arguments. Arguments can be of different
types (ints and floats).</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the zsh/mathfunc module, described in <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fmathfunc-Module">The
zsh/mathfunc Module</a>.</p>
<p><span id="index-zmathfuncdef"></span></p>
<p>zmathfuncdef [ <code>mathfunc</code> [ <code>body</code> ] ]</p>
<p>A convenient front end to functions -M.</p>
<p>With two arguments, define a mathematical function named <code>mathfunc</code>
which can be used in any form of arithmetic evaluation. <code>body</code> is a
mathematical expression to implement the function. It may contain
references to position parameters $1, $2, ... to refer to mandatory
parameters and ${1:-<code>defvalue</code>} ... to refer to optional parameters.
Note that the forms must be strictly adhered to for the function to
calculate the correct number of arguments. The implementation is held in
a shell function named zsh_math_func_<code>mathfunc</code>; usually the user will
not need to refer to the shell function directly. Any existing function
of the same name is silently replaced.</p>
<p>With one argument, remove the mathematical function <code>mathfunc</code> as well
as the shell function implementation.</p>
<p>With no arguments, list all <code>mathfunc</code> functions in a form The functions
have not necessarily been defined by zmathfuncdef.</p>

<h2 id="2611-user-configuration-functions"><a class="header" href="#2611-user-configuration-functions">26.11 User Configuration Functions</a></h2>
<p>The zsh/newuser module comes with a function to aid in configuring shell
options for new users. If the module is installed, this function can
also be run by hand. It is available even if the module’s default
behaviour, namely running the function for a new user logging in without
startup files, is inhibited.</p>
<p>zsh-newuser-install [ -f ]<br />
The function presents the user with various options for customizing
their initialization scripts. Currently only ~/.zshrc is handled.
$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc is used instead if the parameter ZDOTDIR is set; this
provides a way for the user to configure a file without altering an
existing .zshrc.</p>
<p>By default the function exits immediately if it finds any of the files
.zshenv, .zprofile, .zshrc, or .zlogin in the appropriate directory. The
option -f is required in order to force the function to continue. Note
this may happen even if .zshrc itself does not exist.</p>
<p>As currently configured, the function will exit immediately if the user
has root privileges; this behaviour cannot be overridden.</p>
<p>Once activated, the function’s behaviour is supposed to be
self-explanatory. Menus are present allowing the user to alter the value
of options and parameters. Suggestions for improvements are always
welcome.</p>
<p>When the script exits, the user is given the opportunity to save the new
file or not; changes are not irreversible until this point. However, the
script is careful to restrict changes to the file only to a group marked
by the lines ‘# Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install’ and ‘# End of
lines configured by zsh-newuser-install’. In addition, the old version
of .zshrc is saved to a file with the suffix .zni appended.</p>
<p>If the function edits an existing .zshrc, it is up to the user to ensure
that the changes made will take effect. For example, if control usually
returns early from the existing .zshrc the lines will not be executed;
or a later initialization file may override options or parameters, and
so on. The function itself does not attempt to detect any such
conflicts.</p>

<p>There are a large number of helpful functions in the Functions/Misc
directory of the zsh distribution. Most are very simple and do not
require documentation here, but a few are worthy of special mention.</p>

<p><span id="index-colors"></span></p>
<p>colors</p>
<p>This function initializes several associative arrays to map color names
to (and from) the ANSI standard eight-color terminal codes. These are
used by the prompt theme system (<a href="#Prompt-Themes">Prompt Themes</a>). You
seldom should need to run colors more than once.</p>
<p>The eight base colors are: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta,
cyan, and white. Each of these has codes for foreground and background.
In addition there are seven intensity attributes: bold, faint, standout,
underline, blink, reverse, and conceal. Finally, there are seven codes
used to negate attributes: none (reset all attributes to the defaults),
normal (neither bold nor faint), no-standout, no-underline, no-blink,
no-reverse, and no-conceal.</p>
<p>Some terminals do not support all combinations of colors and
intensities.</p>
<p>The associative arrays are:</p>
<p>color<br />
colour<br />
Map all the color names to their integer codes, and integer codes to the
color names. The eight base names map to the foreground color codes, as
do names prefixed with ‘fg-’, such as ‘fg-red’. Names prefixed with
‘bg-’, such as ‘bg-blue’, refer to the background codes. The reverse
mapping from code to color yields base name for foreground codes and the
bg- form for backgrounds.</p>
<p>Although it is a misnomer to call them ‘colors’, these arrays also map
the other fourteen attributes from names to codes and codes to names.</p>
<p>fg<br />
fg_bold<br />
fg_no_bold<br />
Map the eight basic color names to ANSI terminal escape sequences that
set the corresponding foreground text properties. The fg sequences
change the color without changing the eight intensity attributes.</p>
<p>bg<br />
bg_bold<br />
bg_no_bold<br />
Map the eight basic color names to ANSI terminal escape sequences that
set the corresponding background properties. The bg sequences change the
color without changing the eight intensity attributes.</p>
<p>In addition, the scalar parameters reset_color and bold_color are set to
the ANSI terminal escapes that turn off all attributes and turn on bold
intensity, respectively.</p>

with segments separated by dots or dashes. If the <code>present</code> string is
not provided, $ZSH_VERSION is used. Segments are paired left-to-right in
the two strings with leading non-number parts ignored. If one string has
fewer segments than the other, the missing segments are considered zero.</p>
<p>This is useful in startup files to set options and other state that are
not available in all versions of zsh.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">is-at-least 3.1.6-15 &amp;&amp; setopt NO_GLOBAL_RCS

<p><span id="index-nslookup"></span></p>
<p>nslookup [ <code>arg</code> ... ]</p>
<p>This wrapper function for the nslookup command requires the zsh/zpty
module (see <a href="Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fzpty-Module">The zsh/zpty
Module</a>). It behaves exactly
like the standard nslookup except that it provides customizable prompts
(including a right-side prompt) and completion of nslookup commands,
host names, etc. (if you use the function-based completion system).
Completion styles may be set with the context prefix
‘:completion:nslookup’.</p>
<p>See also the pager, prompt and rprompt styles below.</p>
<p><span id="index-regexp_002dreplace"></span></p>
<p>regexp-replace <code>var</code> <code>regexp</code> <code>replace</code></p>
<p>Use regular expressions to perform a global search and replace operation
on a variable. POSIX extended regular expressions (ERE) are used, unless
the option RE_MATCH_PCRE has been set, in which case Perl-compatible
regular expressions are used (this requires the shell to be linked
against the pcre library).</p>
<p><code>var</code> is the name of the variable containing the string to be matched.
The variable will be modified directly by the function. The variables
MATCH, MBEGIN, MEND, match, mbegin, mend should be avoided as these are
used by the regular expression code.</p>
<p><code>regexp</code> is the regular expression to match against the string.</p>
<p><code>replace</code> is the replacement text. This can contain parameter, command
and arithmetic expressions which will be replaced: in particular, a
reference to $MATCH will be replaced by the text matched by the pattern.</p>
<p>The return status is 0 if at least one match was performed, else 1.</p>
<p>Note that if using POSIX EREs, the ^ or word boundary operators (where
available) may not work properly.</p>
<p><span id="index-run_002dhelp-1"></span></p>
<p>run-help <code>cmd</code></p>
<p>This function is designed to be invoked by the run-help ZLE widget, in
place of the default alias. See ‘Accessing On-Line Help’
(<a href="#Utilities">Utilities</a>) for setup instructions.</p>
<p>In the discussion which follows, if <code>cmd</code> is a file system path, it is
first reduced to its rightmost component (the file name).</p>
<p>Help is first sought by looking for a file named <code>cmd</code> in the directory
named by the HELPDIR parameter. If no file is found, an assistant
function, alias, or command named run-help-<code>cmd</code> is sought. If found,
the assistant is executed with the rest of the current command line
(everything after the command name <code>cmd</code>) as its arguments. When neither
file nor assistant is found, the external command ‘man <code>cmd</code>’ is run.</p>
<p>An example assistant for the &quot;ssh&quot; command:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">run-help-ssh() {
    emulate -LR zsh
    local -a args
    # Delete the &quot;-l username&quot; option
    zparseopts -D -E -a args l:
    # Delete other options, leaving: host command
    args=(${@:#-*})
    if [[ ${#args} -lt 2 ]]; then
        man ssh
    else
        run-help $args[2]
    fi
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Several of these assistants are provided in the Functions/Misc your
search path, in order to be found and used by run-help.</p>

<p>tetris</p>
<p>Zsh was once accused of not being as complete as Emacs, because it
lacked a Tetris game. This function was written to refute this vicious
slander.</p>
<p>This function must be used as a ZLE widget:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">autoload -U tetris
zle -N tetris
bindkey keys tetris
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>To start a game, execute the widget by typing the <code>keys</code>. Whatever
command line you were editing disappears temporarily, and your keymap is
also temporarily replaced by the Tetris control keys. The previous
editor state is restored when you quit the game (by pressing ‘q’) or
when you lose.</p>
<p>If you quit in the middle of a game, the next invocation of the tetris
widget will continue where you left off. If you lost, it will start a
new game.</p>
<p>tetriscurses</p>
<p>This is a port of the above to zcurses. The input handling is improved a
bit so that moving a block sideways doesn’t automatically advance a
timestep, and the graphics use unicode block graphics.</p>
<p>This version does not save the game state between invocations, and is
not invoked as a widget, but rather as:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">autoload -U tetriscurses
tetriscurses
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span id="index-zargs"></span></p>
<p>zargs [ <code>option</code> ... -- ] [ <code>input</code> ... ] [ -- <code>command</code> [ <code>arg</code>
... ] ]</p>
<p>This function has a similar purpose to GNU xargs. Instead of reading
lines of arguments from the standard input, it takes them from the
command line. This is useful because zsh, especially with recursive glob
operators, often can construct a command line for a shell function that
is longer than can be accepted by an external command.</p>
<p>The <code>option</code> list represents options of the zargs command itself, which
are the same as those of xargs. The <code>input</code> list is the collection of
strings (often file names) that become the arguments of the command,
analogous to the standard input of xargs. Finally, the <code>arg</code> list
consists of those arguments (usually options) that are passed to the
<code>command</code> each time it runs. The <code>arg</code> list precedes the elements from
the input list in each run. If no <code>command</code> is provided, then no <code>arg</code>
list may be provided, and in that event the default command is ‘print’
with arguments ‘-r --’.</p>
<p>For example, to get a long ls listing of all non-hidden plain files in
the current directory or its subdirectories:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">autoload -U zargs
zargs -- **/*(.) -- ls -ld --
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The first and third occurrences of ‘--’ are used to mark the end of
options for zargs and ls respectively to guard against filenames
starting with ‘-’, while the second is used to separate the list of
files from the command to run (‘ls -ld –’).</p>
<p>The first ‘--’ would also be needed if there was a chance the list might
be empty as in:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zargs -r -- ./*.back(#qN) -- rm -f
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In the event that the string ‘--’ is or may be an <code>input</code>, the -e option
may be used to change the end-of-inputs marker. Note that this does
<em>not</em> change the end-of-options marker. For example, to use ‘..’ as the
marker:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zargs -e.. -- **/*(.) .. ls -ld --
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This is a good choice in that example because no plain file can be named
‘..’, but the best end-marker depends on the circumstances.</p>
<p>The options -i, -I, -l, -L, and -n differ slightly from their usage in
xargs. There are no input lines for zargs to count, so -l and -L count
through the <code>input</code> list, and -n counts the number of arguments passed
to each execution of <code>command</code>, <em>including</em> any <code>arg</code> list. Also, any
time -i or -I is used, each <code>input</code> is processed separately as if by ‘-L
1’.</p>
<p>For details of the other zargs options, see the xargs(1) man page (but
note the difference in function between zargs and xargs) or run zargs
with the --help option.</p>
<p><span id="index-zed"></span></p>
<p>zed [ -f [ -x <code>num</code> ] ] <code>name</code></p>
<p>zed [ -h [ <code>name</code> ] <code>size</code> ]</p>
<p>zed -b</p>
<p>This function uses the ZLE editor to edit a file or function.</p>
<p>Only one <code>name</code> argument is allowed. If the -f option is given, the name
is taken to be that of a function; if the function is marked for
autoloading, zed searches for it in the fpath and loads it. Note that
functions edited this way are installed into the current shell, but
<em>not</em> written back to the autoload file. In this case the -x option
specifies that leading tabs indenting the function according to syntax
should be converted into the given number of spaces; ‘-x 2’ is
consistent with the layout of functions distributed with the shell.</p>
<p>Without -f, <code>name</code> is the path name of the file to edit, which need not
exist; it is created on write, if necessary. With -h, the file is
presumed to contain history events.</p>
<p>When no file name is provided for -h the current shell history is edited
in place. The history is renumbered when zed exits successfully.</p>
<p>When editing history, multi-line events must have a trailing backslash
on every line before the last.</p>
<p>While editing, the function sets the main keymap to zed and the vi
command keymap to zed-vicmd. These will be copied from the existing main
and vicmd keymaps if they do not exist the first time zed is run. They
can be used to provide special key bindings used only in zed.</p>
<p>If it creates the keymap, zed rebinds the return key to insert a line
break and ‘^X^W’ to accept the edit in the zed keymap, and binds ‘ZZ’ to
accept the edit in the zed-vicmd keymap.</p>
<p>The bindings alone can be installed by running ‘zed -b’. This is this
will overwrite the existing zed and zed-vicmd keymaps.</p>
<p>Completion is available, and styles may be set with the context prefix
‘:completion:zed:’.</p>
<p><span id="index-zed_002dset_002dfile_002dname"></span></p>
<p>A zle widget zed-set-file-name is available. This can be called by name
from within zed using ‘\ex zed-set-file-name’ or can be bound to a key
in either of the zed or zed-vicmd keymaps after ‘zed -b’ has been run.
When the widget is called, it prompts for a new name for the file being
edited. When zed exits the file will be written under that name and the
original file will be left alone. The widget has no effect when invoked
from ‘zed -f’. The completion context is changed to
‘:completion:zed-set-file-name:’. When editing the current history with
‘zed -h’, the history is first updated and then the file is written, but
the global setting of HISTFILE is not altered.</p>
<p>While zed-set-file-name is running, zed uses the keymap
zed-normal-keymap, which is linked from the main keymap in effect at the
time zed initialised its bindings. (This is to make the return key
operate normally.) The result is that if the main keymap has been
changed, the widget won’t notice. This is not a concern for most users.</p>
<p><span id="index-zcp"></span> <span id="index-zln"></span></p>
<p>zcp [ -finqQvwW ] <code>srcpat</code> <code>dest</code></p>
<p>zln [ -finqQsvwW ] <code>srcpat</code> <code>dest</code></p>
<p>Same as zmv -C and zmv -L, respectively. These functions do not appear
in the zsh distribution, but can be created by linking zmv to the names
zcp and zln in some directory in your fpath.</p>
<p>zkbd</p>
<p>See ‘Keyboard Definition’ (<a href="#Utilities">Utilities</a>).</p>
<p><span id="index-zmv"></span></p>
<p>zmv [ -finqQsvwW ] [ -C | -L | -M | -{p|P} <code>program</code> ] [ -o
<code>optstring</code> ]</p>
<p>    <code>srcpat</code> <code>dest</code></p>
<p>Move (usually, rename) files matching the pattern <code>srcpat</code> to
corresponding files having names of the form given by <code>dest</code>, where
<code>srcpat</code> contains parentheses surrounding patterns which will be
replaced in turn by $1, $2, ... in <code>dest</code>. For example,</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zmv '(*).lis' '$1.txt'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>renames ‘foo.lis’ to ‘foo.txt’, ‘my.old.stuff.lis’ to
‘my.old.stuff.txt’, and so on.</p>
<p>The pattern is always treated as an EXTENDED_GLOB pattern. Any file
whose name is not changed by the substitution is simply ignored. Any
error (a substitution resulted in an empty string, two substitutions
gave the same result, the destination was an existing regular file and
-f was not given) causes the entire function to abort without doing
anything.</p>
<p>In addition to pattern replacement, the variable $f can be referred to
in the second (replacement) argument. This makes it possible to use
variable substitution to alter the argument; see examples below.</p>
<p>Options:</p>
<p>-f<br />
Force overwriting of destination files. Not currently passed down to the
mv/cp/ln command due to vagaries of implementations (but you can use
-o-f to do that).</p>
<p>-i<br />
Interactive: show each line to be executed and ask the user whether to
execute it. ‘Y’ or ‘y’ will execute it, anything else will skip it. Note
that you just need to type one character.</p>
<p>-n<br />
No execution: print what would happen, but don’t do it.</p>
<p>-q<br />
Turn bare glob qualifiers off: now assumed by default, so this has no
effect.</p>
<p>-Q<br />
Force bare glob qualifiers on. Don’t turn this on unless you are
actually using glob qualifiers in a pattern.</p>
<p>-s<br />
Symbolic, passed down to ln; only works with -L.</p>
<p>-v<br />
Verbose: print each command as it’s being executed.</p>
<p>-w<br />
Pick out wildcard parts of the pattern, as described above, and
implicitly add parentheses for referring to them.</p>
<p>-W<br />
Just like -w, with the addition of turning wildcards in the replacement
pattern into sequential ${1} .. ${N} references.</p>
<p>-C<br />
-L<br />
-M<br />
Force cp, ln or mv, respectively, regardless of the name of the
function.</p>
<p>-p <code>program</code><br />
Call <code>program</code> instead of cp, ln or mv. Whatever it does, it should at
least understand the form</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">program -- oldname newname
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>where <code>oldname</code> and <code>newname</code> are filenames generated by zmv. <code>program</code>
will be split into words, so might be e.g. the name of an archive tool
plus a copy or rename subcommand.</p>
<p>-P <code>program</code><br />
As -p <code>program</code>, except that <code>program</code> does not accept a following -- to
indicate the end of options. In this case filenames must already be in a
sane form for the program in question.</p>
<p>-o <code>optstring</code><br />
The <code>optstring</code> is split into words and passed down verbatim to the cp,
ln or mv command called to perform the work. It should probably begin
with a ‘-’.</p>
<p>Further examples:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zmv -v '(* *)' '${1// /_}'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>For any file in the current directory with at least one space in the
name, replace every space by an underscore and display the commands
executed.</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zmv -v '* *' '${f// /_}'
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This does exactly the same by referring to the file name stored in $f.</p>
<p>For more complete examples and other implementation details, see the zmv
source file, usually located in one of the directories named in your
fpath, or in Functions/Misc/zmv in the zsh distribution.</p>
<p>zrecompile</p>
<p>See ‘Recompiling Functions’ (<a href="#Utilities">Utilities</a>).</p>
<p><span id="index-zstyle_002b"></span></p>
<p>zstyle+ <code>context</code> <code>style</code> <code>value</code> [ + <code>subcontext</code> <code>style</code> <code>value</code> ...
]</p>
<p>This makes defining styles a bit simpler by using a single ‘+’ as a
special token that allows you to append a context name to the previously
used context name. Like this:</p>
<div class="example">
<pre><code class="language-zsh">zstyle+ ':foo:bar' style1 value1 \ 
       +':baz'     style2 value2 \ 
       +':frob'    style3 value3
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This defines <code>style1</code> with <code>value1</code> for the context :foo:bar as usual,
but it also defines <code>style2</code> with <code>value2</code> for the context :foo:bar:baz
and <code>style3</code> with <code>value3</code> for :foo:bar:frob. Any <code>subcontext</code> may be
the empty string to re-use the first context unchanged.</p>
<hr />
<p><span id="Styles"></span></p>
<h3 id="26122-styles"><a class="header" href="#26122-styles">26.12.2 Styles</a></h3>
<p><span id="index-insert_002dtab_002c-completion-style-1"></span></p>
<p>insert-tab</p>
<p>The zed function <em>sets</em> this style in context ‘:completion:zed:*’ to
turn off completion when TAB is typed at the beginning of a line. You
may override this by setting your own value for this context and style.</p>
<p><span id="index-pager_002c-nslookup-style"></span></p>
<p>pager</p>
<p>The nslookup function looks up this style in the context ‘:nslookup’ to
determine the program used to display output that does not fit on a
single screen.</p>
<p><span id="index-prompt_002c-nslookup-style"></span> <span
id="index-rprompt_002c-nslookup-style"></span></p>
<p>prompt</p>
<p>rprompt</p>
<p>The nslookup function looks up this style in the context ‘:nslookup’ to
set the prompt and the right-side prompt, respectively. The usual
expansions for the PS1 and RPS1 parameters may be used (see <a href="Prompt-Expansion.html#Prompt-Expansion">Prompt
Expansion</a>).</p>
